              "{2014: '<p>&#8216;Traitors!&#8221; screamed the headline of the New York Daily News. &#8220;Beneath the dignity of the institution I revere,&#8221; huffed Vice President Joe Biden. &#8220;Dangerous and irresponsible,&#8221; opined the Washington Post&#8217;s David Ignatius. President Obama offered that it was &#8220;ironic&#8221; that the senators were on the same side as supposed &#8220;hardliners&#8221; in Iran.</p> \\n\\n<p>The occasion for all of this snorting and pawing of earth was the letter signed by 47 Senate Republicans explaining to Iran&#8217;s leadership that an &#8220;executive agreement&#8221; is only valid for the term of the executive.</p> \\n\\n<p>President Obama mentioned irony. Here&#8217;s the one he doesn&#8217;t see: He is hardly in a position to rebuke another branch for exceeding its constitutional authority.</p> \\n\\n<p>First, a word about the executive branch. Though many presidents have claimed (and often been granted) primacy in foreign affairs, this is tradition, not law. The president must submit treaties to the Senate for &#8220;advise and consent.&#8221; He has the power to make ambassadorial appointments (again, with the Senate&#8217;s okay), and he is Commander-in-Chief. He is nowhere designated the sole arbiter of foreign policy. When Republicans have held the Oval Office, Democrats from David Bonior to Nancy Pelosi to Jimmy Carter have flagrantly intervened in relations with foreign governments.</p> \\n\\n<p>President Obama has never been punctilious about the Constitution. He has flouted the duty to &#8220;faithfully execute&#8221; the law whenever it was, as his former secretary of state might put it, &#8220;convenient.&#8221; It is unlawful to change the terms ofObamacare by fiat as he has done countless times. It is unlawful to change immigration law after carefully explaining at least a dozen times why he lacked the authority to do so. He is not permitted to tell the Senate when they are in recess (as the Supreme Court affirmed 9&#8211;0), or to terminate the pensions of non-union employees at GM. This is a very partial list.</p> \\n\\n<p>The president who claimed, in an abrupt about-face in 2013, that he would request congressional authorization for air strikes on Syria because &#8220;I believe that the people&#8217;s representatives must be invested in what America does abroad,&#8221; now proposes to conclude a treaty with America&#8217;s most dangerous enemy and to sidestep the Senate&#8217;s advice-and-consent role by playing word games.</p> \\n\\n<p>It isn&#8217;t just that the Iranians cannot be trusted. The president cannot be trusted. After six years, the evidence of his duplicity is abundant. The deceits about keeping your doctor and the tale about his mother&#8217;s being denied coverage when she had cancer will forever besmirch his signature legislation. With members of the Supreme Court sitting a few feet away, he falsely claimed that the Citizens United case would permit foreign money to corrupt U.S. elections. This is another partial list.</p> \\n\\n<p>The most consequential and possibly catastrophic of Obama&#8217;s lies have concerned Iran. One almost pities those fair-minded people, like The Atlantic&#8217;s Jeffrey Goldberg, who trusted him. In 2012, noting that many analysts disbelieved Obama&#8217;s promises about preventing Iran from going nuclear, Goldberg wrote: &#8220;I&#8217;m in the camp of people, however, who take him at his word, in part because he&#8217;s repeated himself on the subject so many times and in part because he has laid out such an effective argument against containment and for disruption, by force, if necessary.&#8221; Among the most persuasive of Obama&#8217;s pledges were these:</p> \\n\\n<p>October 2008: &#8220;I will continue to be clear on the fact that an Iranian nuclear weapon would be profoundly destabilizing for the entire region. It is strongly in America&#8217;s interest to prevent such a scenario.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>June 2008: &#8220;The danger from Iran is grave, it is real, and my goal will be to eliminate this threat.&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;Finally, let there be no doubt: I will always keep the threat of military action on the table to defend our security and our ally Israel.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>March 6, 2012: &#8220;And what I have said is, is that we will not countenance Iran getting a nuclear weapon. My policy is not containment; my policy is to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon &#8212; because if they get a nuclear weapon that could trigger an arms race in the region . . . it could potentially fall into the hands of terrorists.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>In fact, as Michael Doran (Mosaic magazine), Michael Ledeen (PJ Media), Walter Russell Mead (The American Interest), and others have documented, the president&#8217;s true wish &#8211; for a d&#233;tente with Iran including a deal paving the way to nuclear status &#8211; has long been evident but became brazenly so after he was safely reelected. The 47 senators who signed that letter are not just afraid of a nuclear Iran. They are afraid of our president.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8212; Mona Charen is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center. &#169;&amp;#160;2015 Creators Syndicate, Inc.</p>',\n",
              " 2241: '<p /> \\n\\n<p>On July 19, 2011, in a briefing at the State department meant to bring attention to the drought and famine conditions afflicting over 11 million people in the Horn of Africa, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Johnnie Carson reprehensibly stated &#8220;there are many more in need in Eritrea, where a repressive regime is refusing to provide data on the humanitarian needs of its people&#8221;. That statement is not only inflammatory and entirely self-serving but completely politically motivated.</p> \\n\\n<p>To begin with, how can Mr. Carson ascertain with certainty &#8220;that there are many more in need in Eritrea&#8221; when he doesn&#8217;t even know the true facts on the ground in Eritrea? It&#8217;s reprehensible that Mr. Carson and the State Dept. would use the current conditions in the Horn to try to take political pot-shots at the Eritrean government. It is worth pointing out that there are currently tens of thousands of Diaspora Eritreans vacationing throughout Eritrea. Any hint of starvation or famine would have made it out.</p> \\n\\n<p>Second, Mr. Carson should be reminded that his Ethiopian ally Meles Zenawi just recently publicly announced that Ethiopia would be buying over $100 million dollars&#8217; worth of tanks from Ukraine. This is against the backdrop of the drought/famine in Ethiopia and at a time when the Ethiopian government is appealing for nearly $400 million to feed nearly 4 million of its own citizens.</p> \\n\\n<p>What makes this even more perverse is that recently IGAD, at the behest of the Ethiopian government and in concert with the US administration, is calling for increasing the sanctions against Eritrea, &#8220;specifically targeting Eritrea&#8217;s mining revenues and Diaspora remittances&#8221;, which would/could be used by Eritrea to not only feed itself without having to rely on aid handouts, but develop its economy.</p> \\n\\n<p>In light of this, Mr. Carson and the US State Department&#8217;s statement ring not only hollow, but are deeply shameful and disgusting. They should stick to trying to help the people of the Horn, rather than using it as an excuse to try to shame or embarrass the Eritrea. And if Mr. Carson and the US State Department are genuinely interested in the well-being of Eritreans, as they claim they are, the US should be voting against sanctioning the country&#8217;s meager resources and compounding Eritrean&#8217;s problems.</p>',\n",
              " 2246: '<p /> \\n\\n<p>Nearly six months have passed since the Israeli army ceased pounding the tiny stretch of land that is the Gaza Strip. Since then, Gaza continues to appear on the news once in a while, as a recurring subject of human misery.</p> \\n\\n<p>The tireless efforts of British MP George Galloway, and the courageous endeavors of the Free Gaza movement have managed to push Gaza back into the spotlight, even if momentarily and with political context which is lacking at best.</p> \\n\\n<p>Aside from that, the three-week Israeli onslaught in Gaza starting on December 27, and the catastrophic conditions endured there, have served as a mere footnote in many news reports. The event is generally cited as such: \"Israel moved against Hamas in Gaza to quell the firing of militants\\' rockets, resulting in the death of such and such number.\" Hamas, according to media conventional wisdom, is the \"militant group that ousted Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas\\' forces in a bloody coup in mid 2007.\"</p> \\n\\n<p>Sadly, one\\'s worst fears have been realized, where the world of the post-Gaza massacre and that which existed before are exactly the same. Israel is trying to prove that political and military might overpower all human rights reports combined, and that public opinion, which turned against Israel as it wantonly killed and wounded thousands, will eventually turn back in Israel\\'s favor.</p> \\n\\n<p>One does not need to be an expert in the art of propaganda to predict that the public relations model would allow Israel to deceive millions into believing that the belligerent state is in fact a victim in a sea of hostile Arabs hell-bent on subjugating the Jewish State.</p> \\n\\n<p>Thus it was hardly a deviation from the script when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu used a most shrewd term to depict his government\\'s refusal to respect international law regarding the dismantling of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, all considered illegal under international law; specifically, the Fourth Geneva Convention. He said during his recent trip to Germany that the West Bank will never be \"Judenrein\" a Nazi term meaning \"cleansed of Jews\".</p> \\n\\n<p>And once again, Israel is resorting to its traditional propaganda (such as equating Palestinians with Nazis), drawing on people\\'s historical sympathies, guilt and ignorance of false analogies.</p> \\n\\n<p>Moreover, Israel\\'s National Security Advisor Uzi Arad is in fact reviving the discredited Israeli rhetoric that Israel has no partner in peace, in comments made to Israeli newspaper Haaretz on Friday, July 10.</p> \\n\\n<p>He questioned whether there is in fact a Palestinian leadership that is capable of delivering peace with Israel. If such a Palestinian state were to exist, say by 2015, according to Arad it would be a \"fragile structure. A house of cards.\"</p> \\n\\n<p>But he chose to omit that Israel purposely besieged and weakened the democratically elected Palestinian leadership in Gaza, while painstakingly propping and legitimizing Abbas.</p> \\n\\n<p>Only Israel can cleverly spawn a dependent, weak leadership, and accuse the Palestinians of not being a worthy peace partner; only Israel can murder thousands of Palestinians and demand security from its victims; only Israel can caution of a Nazi past, yet cage Palestinians in concentration camps, punish them for recklessly subscribing to the wrong God, or foolishly falling into the wrong race.</p> \\n\\n<p>It has been six months since the unprecedented and savage war against Palestinians in Gaza, and here we are making the same argument, referencing the same deceit and quoting the same outrageous claims.</p> \\n\\n<p>During those same months, unsubstantiated Israeli accounts were countered with carefully composed reports by highly regarded organizations, such as the Red Cross, among others. Bombarded Gaza neighborhoods \"look like the epicenter of a massive earthquake,\" said a recent Red Cross report, entitled: \"Gaza: 1.5 million trapped in despair.\"</p> \\n\\n<p>UN human rights envoy, Richard Falk summed up Israeli behavior in more direct terms, on Thursday, July 9. \"There will be no peace between these two peoples, until Israel shows respect for Palestinian rights under international law,\" Professor Falk said.</p> \\n\\n<p>Israeli leaders, however, pay no heed to international law. In fact there is little evidence that Israel\\'s history was shaped, in any respect, by international standards, neither those pertaining to war nor peace. Israel only understands the language of politics and power. It is a state that has been constructed, and sustained upon Machiavellian wisdom.</p> \\n\\n<p>Advisor Arad is perhaps the most visible manifestation of the logic that propels the Israeli state. In his recent interview, he demanded that once a state deal is reached with the Palestinians, Israel should be granted a NATO membership as a \"quid pro quo\". To counter nuclear threats by others, he said, Israel must have \"tremendously powerful weapons\".</p> \\n\\n<p>Considering that Israel already has nuclear arms, one has to wonder to what other \"tremendously powerful weapons\" Arad is referring. &amp;#160;Arad must\\'ve been encouraged by US Vice President Joe Biden who said in a recent interview with ABC\\'s \"This Week\" that \"If the Netanyahu government decides to take a course of action different than the one being pursed now (by the US and its allies), that is their sovereign right to do that.\"</p> \\n\\n<p>Once again, it is the brute logic that \"might makes right\" pursued by those with the bigger guns that continues to menace the Middle East, with Gaza being the most devastating example.</p> \\n\\n<p>One must remember that Israel never heeds to statements, and is hardly moved by reports and random condemnations. Only pressure, constant and focused, will grab the attention of Israeli policymakers. Only the language of an international campaign of boycott, divestment and sanctions will translate in Tel Aviv to a legible political language.</p> \\n\\n<p>As for Gaza, civil society must not wait for President Obama or any other to save the slowly starving population, but must take every possible and urgent effort to help an oppressed yet proud community to redeem its basic rights and freedom.</p>',\n",

Douglas, one of the most outspoken defenders of the 1st amendment that ever sat on the Supreme Court.&amp;#160; Another was comedian Lenny Bruce, whose brash and <a href=\"http://dangerousminds.net/comments/swear_to_tell_the_truth_excellent_documentary_on_lenny_bruce\" type=\"external\">relentless defiance</a> of &#8220;obscenity&#8221; laws cost him his career &#8211; and probably his life.&amp;#160; Hentoff wrote a <a href=\"http://gadflyonline.com/home/index.php/lenny-bruce-the-crucifixion-of-a-true-believer/\" type=\"external\">touching tribute</a> to Bruce in 2001, entitled, &#8220;The Crucifixion of a True Believer.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Like Bruce, Hentoff believed that while behavior might be criminal, speech never was.&amp;#160; He might have agreed that &#8220;crying fire&#8221; in a crowded theater was a heinous, even unforgivable act, and yet he would have held those who stampeded accountable for their own actions.&amp;#160; To Hentoff, incitement in the spirit of honest inquiry, or expos&#233;, was not a crime &#8212;&amp;#160; it was a calling.</p> \\n\\n<p>For decades as a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/09/nyregion/09nyc.html\" type=\"external\">weekly columnist</a> for Manhattan&#8217;s counter-cultural Village Voice, Hentoff pursued his own version of that calling with zeal.&amp;#160; The subjects of his terse, often sardonic, columns were unpredictable, but the sorry state of American race relations &#8211; which he viewed as the country&#8217;s fatal flaw &#8212; was never far from his mind.</p> \\n\\n<p>A characteristic Hentoff column from the early 1960s recounted the day he rang up Malcolm X of the Nation of Islam and asked for an interview.&amp;#160; Hentoff arrived and sat patiently for close to an hour near a bespectacled man whom he assumed was waiting to see the up-and-coming Black Nationalist leader, too. &amp;#160;Of course, it turned out to be Malcolm X.&amp;#160; The two men laughed at their mutual aloofness, and proceeded to speak at length.</p> \\n\\n<p>Another column treated an encounter on a subway train between a Black conductor and two White passengers, with Hentoff playing the role of curious onlooker.&amp;#160; Without a trace of self-indulgence or artifice, he used the incident to reflect on his own racial fears and prejudice &#8211; and by extension, those of his readers.</p> \\n\\n<p>Hentoff had two great personal obsessions.&amp;#160; One was <a href=\"http://www.villagevoice.com/music/a-young-jazz-pianist-remembers-his-biggest-champion-nat-hentoff-9565145\" type=\"external\">jazz,</a> to which he devoted literally dozens of columns.&amp;#160; To Hentoff jazz reminded us of the improvisational open-endedness of life.&amp;#160; It was the musical equivalent of the unbridled &#8220;free speech&#8221; that he so cherished. &amp;#160;In the flyleaf to <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Nat_Hentoff_Reader.html?id=0A6RJlFY2XcC\" type=\"external\">one</a> of his books, Hentoff placed a quote from jazz musician, Bix Beiderbecke.

              " 5233: '<p>Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8211;Frederick Douglass</p> \\n\\n<p>There was a wide variety of responses to my most recent column which asked if we could finally get over <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Bernie Sanders</a>. Quite a few scorned my words for their alleged bitterness and nastiness towards Sanders, which I can handle, but it also occurred to me that I really should have teased out one final point that indicates what is wrong with the current coordinates.</p> \\n\\n<p>Perhaps it is worth pointing out a few things. First, as someone who follows the entryist tactical playbook of Irving Howe and Michael Harrington&#8217;s Democratic Socialists of America, he has always been and always will be a Democratic Party politician regardless of whether CNN and MSNBC put an (I) next to his name. As <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Paul Street</a> wrote in 2015,</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;[I]n 1988, Sanders got a lesson on the perils of third party politics when he ran for federal office. In the election for Vermont&#8217;s seat in the House of Representatives, the independent Sanders and Democrat Paul Poirer divided the majority vote and the contest went to a Republican. Sanders responded by drifting right and cutting a deal with the Vermont Democrats: the party would permit no serious candidate to run against him while he blocked serious third party formation in Vermont and adopted positions in line with the national corporate war Democrats.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The notion that Sanders somehow is an independent anything is part of a larger campaign that is intended to consolidate the Democratic Party&#8217;s control of a base they do no have a firm grasp on yet (thankfully). Whether Sanders sticks to the noble goals of Howe and Harrington, to transform the Democrats from the inside out without a third party creating an equal external pressure, is besides the point, in effect by refusing to work with third parties he is simply doing a very nasty and duplicitous job in a more effective fashion than Hillary Clinton was able to (which is not exactly a large feat with all things considered in hindsight, by the way).</p> \\n\\n<p>Second, as someone who was involved with the Rhode Island Green Party&#8217;s efforts in 2016 and has remained involved with them since Election Day, I can dutifully report that Sanders has made absolutely zero outreach to any third parties at all. In my mind, this is an issue of high school level political physics. You need to have pressure exerted both internally and externally on the Democratic Party to hope for any change. Yet instead the Democrats have done the following to hinder this. First, they perpetuate a myth about Jill Stein being the reason Trump was elected. Second, the leadership of booster clubs like the Progressive Democrats have remained ambivalent if not outright hostile to Greens, instead allowing random brain fart balloons to float into the aether every once in a while about how &#8220;we need a new party&#8221; as if good people have not already been working on that issue for over 20 years.</p> \\n\\n<p>Third, the so-called &#8220;resistance&#8221; is really not much more than middle-class flash mobs who congregate in a location with signs and feel a sense of accomplishment at the end of a day where no tangible gains were made. Sorry folks but the Civil Rights movement actually got a tangible set of policies from the Democrats. And even then Martin Luther King, Jr. threw up his hands in disgust and denounced the Democratic Party, which at that time was controlled by an entire generation of politicians who were far to the left of Sanders on major issues.</p> \\n\\n<p>The reason for what is wrong here is borne out by this old myth.</p> \\n\\n<p>Many people already know the apocryphal tale of when FDR hosted A. Phillip Randolph at the White House. After being presented with demands, he is alleged to have said &#8220;Very good, I agree with your demands. Now go make me do it.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>I remain skeptical of that story and have previously speculated my own counter. After he was inaugurated, FDR called for a multi-day banking holiday and hosted the executives of Wall Street in Washington. Not only was Roosevelt their former Governor in a geographical sense, he was a member of their class in the Marxist sense of the term. It is merely conjecture here on my part but it seems pretty obvious in the hindsight of history that he told these bankers &#8220;Look, you all know what is at play here. The people are in the streets calling for these Welfare state programs. Now we either agree to give them to them now or the next stop for each and every one of us is going to be the guillotine.&#8221; This was less than twenty years after the Russian revolution and at a time when both the Communist Party and the nascent fascist movements neared their moment of most swollen ranks. I tend to believe FDR and his banker classmates accepted an obvious reality and allowed the Democratic Party to be changed from a traditional liberal party into a labor party. Of course the climax here is the anti-Communist hawk John F. Kennedy, son of FDR&#8217;s first SEC chairman, began the revocation of these Welfare state measures through a series of tax cuts only after his brother, the left hand man of Joe McCarthy, had delegitimized and defenestrated the Left that had created this Welfare state and helped incubate the nascent Civil Rights movement during the 1930s and &#8217;40s.</p> \\n\\n<p>The distinction between a labor party and a liberal party might be quite obscure to our unfathomably anti-intellectual republic but it is quite real. Liberal politicians and their parties are in favor of policies and actions that favor the unhindered movement of capital, opposing Welfare state policies that require financing through a progressive tax code, protectionist trade policy, deficit spending, and the public sector generating employment opportunities to move as close as possible to full employment. By contrast, labor parties articulate via legislation the demands of the working class and enact such policies to stave off the guillotine. It is true that since prior to the Civil War that the Democrats had included the labor movement in their base. However, as described by W.E.B. Du Bois in his Black Reconstruction in America when he profiles &#8216;The White Worker&#8217;, this was the segregated element of labor movement, based around the antecedents of Horace Greeley and the AFL, that was alienated from the Abolitionists and also in favor of a colonial-genocidal westward expansion. Du Bois writes:</p> \\n\\n<p>In 1857, George I. Holyoake sent an anti-slavery address to America, signed by 1,800 English workingmen, whom Karl Marx himself was guiding in England, and this made the black American worker a central text&#8230; This English initiative had at first but limited influence in America. The trade unions were willing to admit that the Negroes ought to be free sometime; but at the present, self-preservation called for their slavery; and after all, whites were a different grade of workers from blacks. Even when the Marxian ideas arrived, there was a split; the earlier representatives of the Marxian philosophy in America agreed with the older Union movement in deprecating any entanglement with the abolition controversy.</p> \\n\\n<p>The difference between the two is quite obviously the power dynamic. The ruling class is in charge of liberal parties and the working class is in charge of labor parties.</p> \\n\\n<p>And so we need to ask a pretty simple question at this point, who is in charge of Bernie Sanders and his Our Revolution (TM) organization? Are the near-catatonic labor unions dictating terms of engagement to either? Do we see the Rainbow Coalition or the NAACP or other minority rights advocacy groups interacting with either of them? Is there any indication that either is just barely maintaining control of a swollen and agitated mass of activists who are thinking fondly of the guillotine at this point?</p> \\n\\n<p>I have not personally gotten involved with either the Sanders campaign or now Our Revolution. But my overwhelming sense from observation is things are the exact opposite. Bernie Sanders is a curmudgeonly rock star whose every word is clung to with devotion. Trying to organize for real progressive issues like single-payer healthcare or ending war or transition to renewable energy is just a little bit harder these days because really genuine and good progressives who I want to work with are saying &#8220;No, we have to wait for what Bernie does first.&#8221; The power dynamic here is all wrong and needs to be flipped for anything to develop.</p> \\n\\n<p>Just consider as an example the single-payer issue. Sanders has been saying for a few months now that he intends to submit a single-payer bill to the Senate. Already Rep. John Conyers has introduced HR 676, considered the gold standard of single payer bills. But as Russell Mokhiber pointed out on March 27, &#8220;Sanders has been telling people he will introduce health care reform legislation in the Senate within a couple of weeks. But it&#8217;s not going to be a companion bill to HR 676. Instead, Sanders is telling reporters he wants to &#8216;move toward Medicare for all.&#8217;&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Someone once told me that procrastination and masturbation are essentially the same thing because in the end you are just f%cking yourself. But the fact Sanders is doing this at the expense of literally millions, including myself, who need a decent healthcare plan, makes this closer to a lewd act that usually gets one put on a sex offenders registry after a stint in jail.</p> \\n\\n<p>As for my scorn for Sanders in the past 24 months, perhaps it deserves explanation. I never had interest in Bernie and I was always scornful of his routine, tempting as it was, because I was seeing every day exactly what the Democratic Party actually was, is, and always will be regardless of what a singular politician from Vermont says to the contrary. I work daily with inner city students in Providence, the poorest of the poor. The city is under a type of austerity that mandates what in any decent civilization would be deemed child abuse. My anger at Sanders, which I kindle and harbor every day I walk into work, is based primarily on the fact he dared try to give anything but scorn and condemnation to the Democratic Party whose machine cities, like Providence or Boston, do such awful things to children. I have seen enough children, at the peak of their adolescent development, eating bags of potato chips for breakfast because things are that tough at home. A few months ago, after a minor bout of snow closed schools across the state for a few days, Providence by contrast opened as soon as possible. Reporter <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Dan McGowan</a>explained why :</p> \\n\\n<p>When Providence residents woke up to very little new snow Monday morning, it looked as though Mayor Jorge Elorza made the right call by deciding schools would open on a two-hour delay rather than close altogether&#8230; &#8220;City families rely on the support services and programs that Providence Public Schools provide, including the more than 20,000 free or reduced-price meals provided daily to qualifying students,&#8221; Laura Hart, a spokesperson for the school department, said Sunday&#8230; If the mayor chose to close schools Monday, it would have been the fifth consecutive day off for students. (That includes school closures on Thursday and Friday, plus the weekend.) Elorza didn&#8217;t want to take a chance that some students would be missing out on breakfast or lunch for another day.</p> \\n\\n<p>The impoverishment of those children did not come from Donald Trump or Paul Ryan. That was all done by a Democratic Party machine whose xenophobia and racism shuns the &#8220;ill-ee-gullz&#8221; and excludes them from hiring for even measly jobs. So every day I was seeing this in the morning and at night would go home to see Sanders on television, in his gruff and manipulative way, corral progressives back into the pen of the Democratic Party. How dare he. I was so furious and heartbroken by this that I had nothing but bile in my mouth when I saw his visage on television or heard how people Felt the Bern. Finally one night, after a day of watching this sort of stuff being done to children by the blessed Democratic Party, I finally put on Paul Robeson&#8217;s rendition of Shenandoah, one of the most beautiful songs recorded in human history, and cried for a good hour in a way I have not since I was a child.</p> \\n\\n<p>It was one of those epic sobs that hits the bottom of your stomach like a good sucker punch and cakes your nose with snot so thick it feels like you inhaled a half-quart of cake frosting.</p> \\n\\n<p>If I am asked if I choose between Bernie Sanders or the kids I work with, what the hell do you expect from me? That is ultimately the crux of what I felt the Sanders campaign was asking of me, to forgive the Democratic Party for this sort of child abuse. I respect the people who follow Michael Harrington&#8217;s lead with the Democratic Socialists of America and correspond quite frequently with some. But in Providence, money talks and all else walks. Just a few weeks ago Brown University alumnus and DNC Chair Tom Perez rolled into town and indicated the future of progressive politics in the Democratic Party was embodied by&#8230; <a href=\"http://ripr.org/post/dnc-chair-tom-perez-touts-raimondos-college-tuition-plan-smart-investment)\" type=\"external\">Gina Raimondo</a>, the queen of privatizing public services and utilities! Whoopee!</p> \\n\\n<p>Around this same time, a certain ornery New Lefty told me I was a liberal rather than a radical because I said that I think getting those kids decent breakfast was revolutionary. Maybe s/he&#8217;s right, saying that kids should be fed decently with a slogan like PEACE-LAND-BREAD-ALL POWER TO THE SOVIETS never got anywhere. Either way, here is what one Bolshevik said about that sort of thing:</p> \\n\\n<p>Say we want a revolution We better get on right away Well you get on your feet And into the street Singing power to the people</p> \\n\\n<p>If progressives want to have Bernie Sanders involved in their efforts for change, make him beg for your respect. Lead him rather than letting him lead you, preferably in a fashion akin to the dog walker who barely has control of his wards as he is dragged down the sidewalk. The collapse of the Old Left was based around a failure to keep that paramount. Instead, they allowed Joseph Stalin to turn their revolution into a top-down organization that was primarily about worshipping him and excusing his awful behavior. That mistake caused the holocaust of the Vietnam War. We owe it to the children to not make that mistake again. And with climate change broiling the Arctic at an accelerated pace, we don&#8217;t have the time to make it.</p> \\n\\n<p>With Sanders, you must go make him do it or else it will be our ruination. It seems clear that many want Sanders involved in the opposition to Trump. I hope he will take up such a challenge rather than arresting the development of a movement.</p>',\n",

Whitford, a Wisconsin \\n\\n<a href=\"http://www.wpr.org/sites/default/files/166%20-%20order.pdf\" type=\"external\">case</a> on political gerrymandering, during its fall 2017 session. Gerrymandering is the drawing of voting districts to favor one group over another. This case appeals a 2-1 \\n\\n<a href=\"http://www.wpr.org/sites/default/files/166%20-%20order.pdf\" type=\"external\">decision</a> by a three-judge panel for the US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin that struck down a Republican-controlled legislature-drawn voting map drafted in 2011 under \\n\\n<a href=\"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/acts/43\" type=\"external\">Wisconsin Act 43</a>. Republicans won 60 of the 99 seats in the Wisconsin Assembly in 2012, while losing the popular vote by approximately 174,000 votes in sum across those races, according to data analysis conducted by \\n\\n<a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/dec/05/sandy-pasch/pasch-says-democrats-outpolled-republicans-statewi/\" type=\"external\">Politifact</a>. This result showed a shift in previous positive correlations between the popular vote and the number of seats won&amp;#160;in the Wisconsin Assembly. The makeup of the Assembly (a Republican majority) after the 2012 election stayed roughly the same from 2010, when Republicans won the popular vote as well. In 2012, however, Republicans maintained their majority in the Assembly while losing the popular vote. This was a shift from 2006 and 2008 election results, when Democrats held the majority in the Wisconsin Assembly, and won the popular vote as well. Politifact based&amp;#160;its findings on&amp;#160; \\n\\n<a href=\"http://elections.wi.gov/sites/default/files/County%20by%20County_11.6.12%20Gen%20Election_Assembly.pdf\" type=\"external\">district-by-district numbers</a> available on the state&#8217;s \\n\\n<a href=\"http://elections.wi.gov/elections-voting/2012/fall\" type=\"external\">Government Accountability Board website</a>. The plaintiffs, who are voters across the state, won at the district court level, and the redistricted voting map pursuant to Act 43 was found to be unconstitutional. This appeal to SCOTUS was sought by Wisconsin&#8217;s Attorney General Brad Schimel, who hopes to show the legislative districts are constitutional and not politically gerrymandered. The \\n\\n<a href=\"http://www.wpr.org/sites/default/files/166%20-%20order.pdf\" type=\"external\">District Court</a>&amp;#160;stated: Schimel responded in a \\n\\n<a href=\"https://www.doj.state.wi.us/news-releases/ag-schimel-statement-scotus-decision-take-redistricting-case\" type=\"external\">statement</a> Monday to the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision to hear&amp;#160;the appeal: The districts, as drawn&amp;#160;in 2011, are viewable \\n\\n<a href=\"https://data-ltsb.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/b52f3c49baa840adb070e7c56604de59_0\" type=\"external\">here</a>. SCOTUS last dealt with the issue of partisan gerrymandering in 2004, when it held in \\n\\n<a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/boundvolumes/541bv.pdf\" type=\"external\">Vieth v. Jubelirer</a> that the practice was nonjusticiable &#8212; meaning it&#8217;s not within the court&#8217;s jurisdiction so the court cannot&amp;#160;decide the case. The plurality opinion, held by Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Justice Sandra Day O&#8217;Connor, and Justice Clarence Thomas, concluded: In that case, Pennsylvania&#8217;s General Assembly adopted a congressional redistricting plan which promoted a lawsuit that alleged the plan constituted a political gerrymander in violation of Article I of the US Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment&#8217;s Equal Protection Clause. A three-judge District Court panel dismissed the gerrymandering claim, the case was appealed, and SCOTUS affirmed the dismissal. Voting districts must be similar in population for state and local election purposes, and nearly mathematically identical in population for US congressional voting districts. In \\n\\n<a href=\"http://www.wpr.org/sites/default/files/166%20-%20order.pdf\" type=\"external\">Gill v. Whitford</a>, the plaintiffs proposed a method called the &#8220;efficiency gap&#8221; to determine whether unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering has taken place. Wisconsin Public Radio&#8217;s Shawn Johnson explained the method to \\n\\n<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/11/23/503182780/federal-court-rules-wisconsin-legislative-map-violates-the-constitution\" type=\"external\">NPR</a>&#8216;s Kelly McEvers in November. Johnson said: On Monday, SCOTUS \\n\\n<a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/061917zr_6537.pdf\" type=\"external\">granted a stay</a>&amp;#160;of the appellate court&#8217;s ruling that Wisconsin&#8217;s congressional districts be redrawn in the fall &#8212; meaning the ruling is put on hold and the districts will remain as is&amp;#160;for now. The order stated: The issue of whether SCOTUS has jurisdiction to hear the case has been reserved until the case itself is heard on the merits, according to the SCOTUS \\n\\n<a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/061917zor_6537.pdf\" type=\"external\">order list</a> published Monday. Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel sought the appeal now before the court.

They wrote: The dissenting judge in the lower court decision argued that the efficiency gap standard put forth by the plaintiffs in the original district court case would not solve the problem of creating a manageable method by which to judge whether partisan gerrymandering had taken place, and so the case should remain nonjusticiable.

Of the three serious wars that the U.S. has fought since 1945&#8211;Korea, Vietnam and the Gulf War, one ended in defeat and two in draws&#8211;not exactly a glorious record.</p> \\n\\n<p>An Iraq war likewise could end in stalemate. Saddam Hussein is not the Taliban. A war would require a large-scale land invasion of an American-British force that would undoubtedly suffer significant casualties. It would also need staging grounds and this time round Saudi Arabia, the main base for the Gulf War, is unlikely to agree to offer its services. Moreover, what does America do if Saddam decides to use the horrible weapons he is said to possess? It&#8217;s one thing for him to use them&#8211;the entire world knows he is a rogue&#8211;but if the U.S. and Britain uses them too they will be judged by a different standard.</p> \\n\\n<p>The U.S. suffered immense opprobrium in Vietnam for using napalm, which is nothing as compared with modern day chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. Besides, Iraq presumably would be using its weapons against only troops. If America and Britain retaliated it would be inevitable that civilian Iraqis would be hit as hard as its military. And what happens if the U.S. and Britain simply get bogged down? How do they deal with the mounting distaste for casualties at home? How do they cope with the bitter anti-American sentiments of the Arab world? How does the U.S. fight a second front, if war should open up elsewhere now that the Pentagon has recently abandoned its goal of being able to fight two regional wars simultaneously?</p> \\n\\n<p>Has President George Bush got better nerves than President Lyndon Johnson, once a man of unbendable purpose before his physical and moral degradation in the course of the Vietnam War. Has Vice-President Dick Cheney got more iron in his soul than the steely Robert McNamara, Johnson&#8217;s Secretary of Defence, who later confessed he was started on the road to resignation by the brave decision of a protestor to immolate himself close by the Secretary&#8217;s office? Not least, how will America stand at the end of such a war, particularly when much of the world knows that it failed to answer those who have argued for years that containment was working, more than less?</p> \\n\\n<p>No wonder that there are well-founded reports that both the Pentagon generals and the British General Staff are arguing against this venture. Yet for the moment the juggernaught appears unstoppable. Last week there were reports that the British were withdrawing their troops from Bosnia so that they can be readied for re-deployment in an Iraqi war. Moreover, the very fact that America has not yet laid its hands on Osama bin Laden&#8211;its ostensible purpose in going to war against the Taliba- suggests that the political pressures on Bush to up the ante and topple Saddam Hussein&#8211;who does have a fixed address where he can be located&#8211;are mounting by the day. (It is at this point that the civilian hawks and the military brass part company&#8211;the brass maintain their jobs even if there is no war; the civilians lose theirs if Bush loses his political credibility and goes down to defeat.)</p> \\n\\n<p>How then to head off what could be a disastrous war followed by an even more disastrous stalemate or perhaps an American humiliation? It is not enough to hope that Bush and Cheney might be consumed by some Texan accountancy scandal. Or to think that the resignation of Colin Powell, who as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff opposed consideration of the use of nuclear weapons during the first Gulf War, would seriously disturb the White House once it had set its course.</p> \\n\\n<p>Incredible as it may sound on first hearing the road to avoiding war lies through Pyongyang. Not in the literal sense, but the way that Jimmy Carter paved it with his historic peacemaking trip to North Korea to parley with Kiml Sung. At that moment North Korea and the U.S. appeared to be a collision course over the evidence that the North was building nuclear weapons. President Bill Clinton had on his desk an estimate that war could lead to 50,000 American soldiers dead and the destruction of much of Seoul. North Korea is now the recipient of more American aid than any other Asian country and the Western allies are building two light water nuclear power reactors for it. In return the North has frozen its plutonium production. For all the bluster over &#8220;the axis of evil&#8221; the Bush Administration has not overturned this deal. What would entice Saddam Hussein to cooperate? Number one must be a public announcement by Washington&#8211;one that three successive administrations have refused to make&#8211;that it no longer seeks the end of Saddam&#8217;s regime before it will consider ending sanctions.

              " 6038: '<p>In touting Republican tax bills, President Donald Trump made several claims that don&#8217;t add up.</p> \\n\\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/11/30/remarks-president-trump-tax-reform\" type=\"external\">speech</a> in St. Charles, Missouri, on Nov. 29, Trump praised congressional GOP efforts to overhaul the nation&#8217;s individual and corporate income taxes. As the president said, the House <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/house/360704-house-passes-sweeping-tax-bill-in-victory-for-gop\" type=\"external\">has passed</a> its tax bill, and the president is hoping for a &#8220;successful vote in the Senate this week.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>But there were some factual inaccuracies in the president&#8217;s remarks, including several false talking points we&#8217;ve debunked before.</p> \\n\\n<p>Trump once again distorted the recent history of U.S. economic growth.</p> \\n\\n<p>Trump:&amp;#160;But by the way the Commerce Department announced this morning that our GDP &#8212; that&#8217;s the big one &#8212; in the third quarter grew even faster than they reported previously. They made a mistake. They were too low. They had it at 3 percent. By the way, 3 percent &#8212; did you ever think you would hear that in less than a year? And now it comes in at 3.3 percent which is the largest increase in many years.</p> \\n\\n<p>He&#8217;s right that the real gross domestic product was revised upward to <a href=\"https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/gdpnewsrelease.htm\" type=\"external\">3.3 percent</a> for the third quarter of 2017. (It wasn&#8217;t &#8220;a mistake.&#8221; It merely reflects more and better data.)</p> \\n\\n<p>But it isn&#8217;t &#8220;the largest increase in many years.&#8221; It was larger than that in the third and fourth quarters of 2014, when real GDP increased <a href=\"https://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=19&amp;amp;step=3&amp;amp;isuri=1&amp;amp;1910=x&amp;amp;0=-99&amp;amp;1921=survey&amp;amp;1903=1&amp;amp;1904=2009&amp;amp;1905=2017&amp;amp;1906=q&amp;amp;1911=0#reqid=19&amp;amp;step=3&amp;amp;isuri=1&amp;amp;1910=x&amp;amp;0=-99&amp;amp;1921=survey&amp;amp;1903=1&amp;amp;1904=2009&amp;amp;1905=2017&amp;amp;1906=q&amp;amp;1911=0\" type=\"external\">4.6 percent and 5.2 percent</a>, respectively. It&#8217;s also not unheard of for the U.S. economy to grow quarterly at 3 percent or more, as Trump said. It happened eight times under President Obama, as we <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">wrote</a> when Trump made a similar claim in August.</p> \\n\\n<p>The estimated cost of the Republican tax plans would not be the &#8220;biggest tax cut in the history of our country &#8212; bigger than Reagan,&#8221; as Trump claimed once again. There have been larger cuts as a percentage of gross domestic product and in inflation-adjusted dollars.</p> \\n\\n<p>When <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">we previously wrote</a> about this on Nov. 3, the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation <a href=\"https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&amp;amp;id=5026\" type=\"external\">estimated that the House version</a> of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would cost $1.49 trillion over 10 years. Over the first four years, the average annual cost would be $185 billion. That&#8217;s about 0.9 percent or 1 percent of gross domestic product, depending on what that ends up being in 2018.</p> \\n\\n<p>That would make the House bill the eighth largest cut since 1918, <a href=\"http://www.crfb.org/blogs/president-trumps-tax-cut-largest-history-yet\" type=\"external\">according to the</a> Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget&#8217;s analysis of <a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/tax-analysis/Documents/WP81-Table2013.pdf\" type=\"external\">Treasury Department</a> data. The 1981 tax cut enacted at the beginning of the Reagan administration cost 2.9 percent of GDP over four years. That makes it the largest, CRFB says.</p> \\n\\n<p>In inflation-adjusted dollars, the House GOP plan is also less than three other tax plans. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 cost an average of $320.6 billion over four years, and tax reductions in 2010 ($210 billion) and 1981 ($208 billion) were also more expensive.</p> \\n\\n<p>That&#8217;s why Trump was also wrong when he said &#8220;for years they have not been able to get tax cuts, many, many years since Reagan.&#8221; Since 1997, there have been several major bills cutting taxes that have been signed into law, <a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/tax-analysis/Documents/WP81-Table2013.pdf\" type=\"external\">according a 2013 Treasury Department</a> report. Two of them, as we just said, produced larger cuts than those proposed by Trump and congressional Republicans.</p> \\n\\n<p>More recently, the JCT estimated that an <a href=\"https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&amp;amp;id=5034\" type=\"external\">amended version of the House bill</a> would cost $1.44 trillion, and <a href=\"https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&amp;amp;id=5043\" type=\"external\">the Senate version</a>, at $1.41 trillion, would cost even less. That means those bills wouldn&#8217;t qualify as the biggest tax cut, either.</p> \\n\\n<p>Trump once again claimed that &#8220;middle-class families &#8230;&amp;#160;will see their incomes go up by an average of around $4,000.&#8221;&amp;#160;The $4,000 figure comes from <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/documents/Tax%20Reform%20and%20Wages.pdf\" type=\"external\">two</a>&amp;#160; <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/Corporate%20Tax%20Reform%20and%20Growth%20Final.pdf\" type=\"external\">reports</a>&amp;#160;by the White House Council of Economic Advisers.

Using that as a baseline, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated in a <a href=\"https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&amp;amp;id=5045\" type=\"external\">Nov. 30 report</a> that the Senate tax plan would increase real GDP by only 0.8 percent on average from 2017 to 2027 &#8212; meaning the annual rate of growth would remain below 3 percent.</p> \\n\\n<p>Trump demonstrated exactly why we have been warning that his regular talking point that the U.S. has one of the highest statutory corporate tax rates in the world &#8212; 60 percent higher than other developed countries &#8212; can be misleading. It&#8217;s because it might leave the mistaken impression that U.S. companies pay 60 percent higher taxes than businesses in other countries. They don&#8217;t.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Today, America has one of the least competitive [corporate] tax rates on planet Earth &#8212; 60 percent, think of that, 60 percent higher than the average in the developed world,&#8221; Trump said. &#8220;So our taxes are 60 percent higher.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The first part of that claim is accurate, so long as it is placed in context. The U.S. has&amp;#160;the highest top&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=TABLE_II1\" type=\"external\">statutory corporate tax rate</a>&amp;#160;&#8212; 35 percent, and 39 percent when state taxes are included &#8212; among developed countries. That&#8217;s 60 percent higher than the average statutory rate among 35 countries, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.</p> \\n\\n<p>But as we have <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">explained before</a>, that doesn&#8217;t mean U.S. companies pay more in taxes than in other countries. The average effective tax rate &#8212; what corporations actually pay when tax credits and exemptions are factored in &#8212; is more in line with the world average. The average effective corporate tax rate in 2008 was 27.1 percent, close to the GDP weighted average among other OECD countries, 27.7 percent, according to a 2014&amp;#160; <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41743.pdf\" type=\"external\">Congressional Research Service report</a>.</p> \\n\\n<p>A&amp;#160; <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52419\" type=\"external\">Congressional Budget Office</a>&amp;#160;report in March found that the U.S. ranked third among G20 countries when using an &#8220;average corporate tax rate&#8221; measure, which is &#8220;the total amount of corporate taxes that a company pays as a share of its income.&#8221; And under an &#8220;effective marginal corporate tax rate,&#8221; defined as &#8220;a measure of a corporation&#8217;s tax burden on returns from a marginal investment,&#8221; the U.S. was fourth.</p> \\n\\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=REV\" type=\"external\">OECD</a>, the revenue from taxes from income, profit and capital gains of U.S. corporations in 2016 was 2.2. percent of GDP. That&#8217;s lower than the average among OECD countries.</p> \\n\\n<p>And that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s wrong to make the leap, as Trump did, that because the U.S. statutory rate is 60 percent higher than our competitors, &#8220;our taxes are 60 percent higher.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Trump overstated the amount the U.S. has already spent on the Middle East wars and how much money he will spend on domestic issues.</p> \\n\\n<p>The president said the U.S. has spent &#8220;almost $7 trillion in the Middle East over the last 16 years,&#8221; claiming with that money &#8220;we could have rebuilt our country four times over.&#8221;&amp;#160;But the Department of Defense <a href=\"http://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/fy2018/Section_1090_FY17_NDAA_Cost_of_Wars_to_Per_Taxpayer-July_2017.pdf\" type=\"external\">says</a>&amp;#160;the cost &#8220;for the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria&#8221; through fiscal year 2018 was an estimated $1.52 trillion.</p> \\n\\n<p>During the campaign, Trump&amp;#160; <a href=\"https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/50TopFactsAboutHillaryClintonEconomicAndPoliticalCorruption.pdf\" type=\"external\">used</a>&amp;#160;a $6 trillion estimate, citing a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-war-anniversary/iraq-war-costs-u-s-more-than-2-trillion-study-idUSBRE92D0PG20130314\" type=\"external\">Reuters article</a> about a report on war costs written by Boston University Political Science Professor Neta C. Crawford for&amp;#160;the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University. But that estimate included money spent in the United States in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, not just money spent on the military in the Middle East, and it included&amp;#160;future costs, not money that already had been spent.</p> \\n\\n<p>In an update published earlier this month, Crawford&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2017/Costs%20of%20U.S.%20Post-9_11%20NC%20Crawford%20FINAL%20.pdf\" type=\"external\">said</a>&amp;#160;U.S. military spending in the Middle East &#8220;and the additional spending on Homeland Security, and the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs since the 9/11 attacks,&#8221; has cost $4.3 trillion in current dollars through fiscal year 2017, which ended Sept. 30, and will cost more than $5.6 trillion through the year 2056.</p> \\n\\n<p>In lamenting the cost of the Middle East wars, Trump added, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to start spending here.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Trump&#8217;s proposed <a href=\"http://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/fy2018/fy2018_Budget_Request_Overview_Book.pdf\" type=\"external\">fiscal year 2018 budget</a> includes $64.6 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations, which is the category for continued military operations in the Middle East. That&#8217;s $18.2 billion, or <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R45013.pdf\" type=\"external\">22 percent</a>, less than fiscal 2017. His budget includes <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-presidential-budget-2018-proposal/?utm_term=.4a2b6f2d0313\" type=\"external\">deeper cuts in domestic spending</a>&amp;#160;&#8212; including cutting nearly a third of the Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s budget and eliminating entire programs, such as the Community Development Block Grant program in the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which received <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-budget-asks-for-6-billion-in-hud-cuts-drops-development-grants/2017/03/15/1b157338-09a0-11e7-b77c-0047d15a24e0_story.html?utm_term=.69bbe01f0c4f\" type=\"external\">$3 billion last fiscal year</a>.</p> \\n\\n<p>Trump again took credit for rising employment, noting that 2 million jobs have been added to the economy since his election. &#8220;Nobody expected that,&#8221; Trump said. That number, he said, is &#8220;a lot better, at this point, than anybody ever even thought possible.&#8221; Later, he added, &#8220;We used to lose millions. Now we&#8217;ve created 2 million jobs since I won the election.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>As <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">we have written</a>, Trump inherited an economy that was experiencing steady job growth. It&#8217;s true that the economy lost millions of jobs during the Great Recession. But when Trump took office, the economy&amp;#160;had gained jobs for 75 straight months&amp;#160;&#8211; the&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/03/04/this-is-the-largest-job-growth-streak-ever-kind-of/\" type=\"external\">longest streak</a>&amp;#160;on record. That streak has <a href=\"https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES0000000001\" type=\"external\">continued</a> under Trump.</p> \\n\\n<p /> \\n\\n<p>We typically measure employment from the president&#8217;s inauguration, rather than from the election. Trump chooses to start the clock from his election, arguing that job growth is due in part to consumer confidence buoyed by his victory.</p> \\n\\n<p>But even using this measuring stick, there&#8217;s nothing unusual about the job growth. It&#8217;s true that the number of jobs in the U.S. has grown by 2 million in the 12 months since October 2016, the month before Trump was elected. But it grew by 2.4 million in the 12 months prior to that, by 2.8 million the year before that, and by 2.7 million, 2.4 million and 2.1 million in the years before that. In other words, the job growth of 2 million between October 2016 and October 2017 was less than the growth in each of the previous five years.</p> \\n\\n<p>Trump took a break from discussing the GOP tax plan to repeat a false conservative talking point about the Clean Water Act. He said that, because of a 2015 redefinition of what waters are regulated under the act, people would go to jail if they &#8220;touch&#8221; a puddle on their land.&amp;#160;But the 2015 rule explicitly excludes puddles from the regulation.</p> \\n\\n<p>Trump: You know what I&#8217;ve done for farmers. Where if you had a little puddle in the middle of your field, you go to jail if you touch it, right? You know what I&#8217;m talking about. Not anymore. Not anymore. Not anymore.</p> \\n\\n<p>Since 1972, the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/history-clean-water-act\" type=\"external\">Clean Water Act</a> has made it&amp;#160;&#8220;unlawful for any person to discharge any pollutant from a point source into navigable waters, unless a permit was obtained.&#8221; The EPA <a href=\"https://iaspub.epa.gov/sor_internet/registry/termreg/searchandretrieve/termsandacronyms/search.do?search=&amp;amp;term=point%20source%20pollution&amp;amp;matchCriteria=Contains&amp;amp;checkedAcronym=true&amp;amp;checkedTerm=true&amp;amp;hasDefinitions=false\" type=\"external\">defines</a>&amp;#160;point source pollution as coming from a specific source, such as a pipe, ditch or river tributary. This is opposed to nonpoint pollution, such as runoff.</p> \\n\\n<p>In 2015, the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/06/29/2015-13435/clean-water-rule-definition-of-waters-of-the-united-states\" type=\"external\">redefined</a> which waters can be regulated under the act to reflect new science and court decisions, among other factors.&amp;#160;According to the 2015 rule itself, &#8220;Fewer waters will be defined as &#8216;waters of the United States&#8217; under the rule than under the existing regulations.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The 2015 rule&amp;#160; <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/06/29/2015-13435/clean-water-rule-definition-of-waters-of-the-united-states\" type=\"external\">explicitly excluded</a> puddles from regulation under the Clean Water Act.</p> \\n\\n<p>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and EPA, June 25, 2015:&amp;#160;The final rule adds an exclusion for puddles. The proposed rule did not explicitly exclude puddles because the agencies have never considered puddles to meet the minimum standard for being a &#8220;water of the United States,&#8221; and it is an inexact term. A puddle is commonly considered a very small, shallow, and highly transitory pool of water that forms on pavement or uplands during or immediately after a rainstorm or similar precipitation event. However, numerous commenters asked that the agencies expressly exclude them in a rule. The final rule does so.</p> \\n\\n<p>When Sen. Ted Cruz made a similar claim in March 2016,&amp;#160;William Rodger, a spokesman for the&amp;#160;American Farm Bureau Federation,&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/mar/31/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-epa-tried-regulate-puddles-and-drain/\" type=\"external\">told</a>&amp;#160;PolitiFact that the broad language of the 2015 rule would allow puddles to be classified as vernal pools or wetlands and, thus, still be regulated.</p> \\n\\n<p>But this rationale wasn&#8217;t convincing to the seven environmental experts PolitiFact <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/oct/22/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-epa-rule-covers-water-barely-bigg/\" type=\"external\">interviewed</a> in October 2015, when Sen. Marco Rubio made a similar claim. For example, William L.

              " 6042: '<p>I dearly, dearly love Adam McKay&#8217;s 2004 comedy Anchorman, a scathing and very silly indictment of the vapidity of local news and the cowering terror of men who don&#8217;t want to compete or collaborate with women in professional spaces. But as much as I&#8217;ve been looking forward to the film&#8217;s sequel, due unto us shortly, even I have been feeling a bit of fatigue at the omnipresence of Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell), the titular anchorman, who&#8217;s been making the rounds in everything from car ads to curling commentary, in support of the new film. It&#8217;s hard to imagine there&#8217;s much of Anchorman 2 that hasn&#8217;t been revealed to us in the many, many commercials that have been cut for the movie. And while I trust Ferrell&#8217;s powers of sublimely goofy improvisation, surely there are only so many silly things he can find to say on air before they become somewhat wearying.</p> \\n\\n<p>But there is one bit of Burgundy cross-promotion I would badly like to have seen. Burgundy and Champ Kind (David Koechner) were supposed to co-host ESPN&#8217;s SportsCenter tonight. Their appearance <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2013/12/ron-burgundy-wont-be-hosting-sportscenter.html?mid=twitter_vulture\" type=\"external\">has sensibly been cancelled</a>, since the Florida State Attorney Willie Meggs plans to announce this afternoon whether or not charges will be filed against Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston, who has been accused of sexual assault. It could be gonzo and revealingly brilliant to have Burgundy and Kind cover what will surely be the biggest sports story of the day: the record of the actual sports media had a poor enough record of covering sexual assault cases that it would be fascinating to see how close parody lies to the real thing. But ESPN is right to cover the story straight first, and to recognize that there are people who wouldn&#8217;t see Burgundy and Kind&#8217;s performance for the analysis of sports reporting that it is, and instead would take it as license to treat the accusations against Winston as a joke.</p> \\n\\n<p>If it had been a more mundane news day, though, the clip ESPN released of Burgundy interviewing Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning gives a sense of the revelation that might have been:</p> \\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s become easy to focus on the punchlines of Anchorman jokes rather than the setup. What&#8217;s brilliant about them isn&#8217;t whatever goofy combination of words Burgundy ends with, but the seriousness with which the character approaches all stories without regard to their actual gravity, and his aping of the actual conventions of journalistic language.</p> \\n\\n<p>What&#8217;s funny about Burgundy&#8217;s conversation with Manning isn&#8217;t really that he&#8217;s comparing him to &#8220;a succulent baby lamb&#8221; or suggesting that mustaches are key to football performance. It&#8217;s that Burgundy doesn&#8217;t have to change the setup for any of these questions at all from the phrasing sports anchors use all the time in conversations with athletes. Look at how he starts, telling Manning &#8220;You are one of the great quarterbacks playing the game today, you&#8217;ve had a lot of success.&#8221; That&#8217;s the kind of totally unnecessary affirmation people who talk about sports on television offer to athletes all the time, rather than using their airtime to try to elicit actual information from the athletes in question.</p> \\n\\n<p>Then there&#8217;s his second question for Manning, which begins with a reiteration of basic facts, before offering up the most useless query you can possibly ask someone in public life, and yet that&#8217;s asked constantly: &#8220;So you play in Denver, for the Broncos, at Mile High Stadium. Tell me about your relationship with Thunder.&#8221; Thunder happens to be the Broncos mascot, but what makes the question ludicrous isn&#8217;t that Manning is being asked about his closeness to a plush animal, but that it&#8217;s framed in such a way that it suggests the questioner has done no preparation whatsoever, and allows Manning to serve up talking points. If you&#8217;re going to ask an athlete (or an actor) about a relationship with a teammate or an employer, the only way that inquiry can possibly produce an interesting answer is if it&#8217;s specific. How do you prepare for plays (or scenes)? How have events changed the way you work together? What happened on a specific drive (or a specific workday)? Otherwise, there is absolutely zero possibility that the person being asked a question will repeat anything other than positive pablum that reveals no actual information whatsoever. It&#8217;s a question designed to dissolve into the ether. It serves the interview subject rather than the viewer or reader. It&#8217;s embarrassing.</p> \\n\\n<p>And then there are the cliches, Burgundy talking aimlessly about himself, remembering that &#8220;I used to yell Chekov all the time! No clue what it meant,&#8221; and riffing off LeBron James&#8217; famous television special, saying &#8220;You can have South Beach, LeBron. Ron Burgundy is taking his talents to Bristol.&#8221; The presence of ex-athletes and ex-coaches in the broadcast booth has some advantages in sports broadcasting: it means that anchors and commentators often have deep technical knowledge of the game they&#8217;re covering, and have experienced emotions similar to the ones players, coaches, and managers may be feeling during a significant moment. But possessing that knowledge isn&#8217;t the same as communicating it for a mass audience. And having once been the subject of sports reporting, it can be difficult for these former participants to relinquish their sense that they ought to be the subject of the broadcast, no matter how little they actually have to offer at any given moment. Burgundy captures that self-regard and inability to distinguish matters of import from trivia perfectly.</p> \\n\\n<p>We&#8217;ve got Stephen Colbert on Comedy Central four nights a week offering up a pitch-perfect satire of cable news punditry. But sports coverage, which is consumed by vast numbers of Americans, rarely gets the savaging it deserves. This short clip gives us a sense of what might have been, even as ESPN stays genuinely classy and sticks with serious coverage.</p>',\n",

Maybe it\\'s because feelings are so raw in this post-Weinstein era, where the obstacles women face on their way to success are just beginning to be publicly understood.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"Mudbound\" is beautiful, complex and flawless, regardless of who made it. That it happens to come from a queer black woman is both significant and irrelevant: Brilliance is brilliance, no matter its packaging. But given Hollywood\\'s exclusive (and potentially abusive) power structure, some brilliance must fight harder than others to be heard, and we may never know what less-hardy voices have been silenced through the years by harassment and discrimination.</p> \\n\\n<p>Themes of prejudice and discrimination are also central to the story of \"Mudbound,\" based on the award-winning 2008 novel by Hillary Jordan. Set in the American South in the early 1940s, it\\'s both a tale of two families, one black and one white, and a portrait of an era beset by racism and rigid social rules.</p> \\n\\n<p>Rees\\' telling is literary and cinematic, striking with both words and images. Her script with Virgil Williams captures Jordan\\'s writing style and the characters\\' distinct voices as they alternately narrate the story. And the stunning photography by Rachel Morrison &#8212; leafy woods, light-dappled buildings, watercolor sunsets across enormous skies &#8212; creates a beautifully bucolic setting for the ugly racism that brings life-altering pain to both families.</p> \\n\\n<p>Like a novel, the story gradually then completely absorbs as the characters reveal themselves.

The title refers to the landscape: a central character of soppy farmland that leaves everyone covered in dirt.</p> \\n\\n<p>The drama begins when Henry McAllan (Jason Clarke) moves his family from Memphis to Mississippi to make his farming dreams come true.

Maybe it\\'s because feelings are so raw in this post-Weinstein era, where the obstacles women face on their way to success are just beginning to be publicly understood.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"Mudbound\" is beautiful, complex and flawless, regardless of who made it. That it happens to come from a queer black woman is both significant and irrelevant: Brilliance is brilliance, no matter its packaging. But given Hollywood\\'s exclusive (and potentially abusive) power structure, some brilliance must fight harder than others to be heard, and we may never know what less-hardy voices have been silenced through the years by harassment and discrimination.</p> \\n\\n<p>Themes of prejudice and discrimination are also central to the story of \"Mudbound,\" based on the award-winning 2008 novel by Hillary Jordan. Set in the American South in the early 1940s, it\\'s both a tale of two families, one black and one white, and a portrait of an era beset by racism and rigid social rules.</p> \\n\\n<p>Rees\\' telling is literary and cinematic, striking with both words and images. Her script with Virgil Williams captures Jordan\\'s writing style and the characters\\' distinct voices as they alternately narrate the story. And the stunning photography by Rachel Morrison &#8212; leafy woods, light-dappled buildings, watercolor sunsets across enormous skies &#8212; creates a beautifully bucolic setting for the ugly racism that brings life-altering pain to both families.</p> \\n\\n<p>Like a novel, the story gradually then completely absorbs as the characters reveal themselves. Though there are many, each is wholly drawn. The title refers to the landscape: a central character of soppy farmland that leaves everyone covered in dirt.</p> \\n\\n<p>The drama begins when Henry McAllan (Jason Clarke) moves his family from Memphis to Mississippi to make his farming dreams come true.

And we sometimes say to ourselves, boy, aren&#8217;t we lucky. Well, folks, ever since the end of the Cold War, forces have been unleashed that were tamped down for centuries by dictators, and that was complicated further by this little thing called the internet and the ability of people everywhere to communicate instantaneously and to have more information coming at them in one day than most people can process in months or a year.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>What an elitist. He longs for a world when the Elite, like him, &#8220;process&#8221; everything, and the rest of us are left out. He continued about the Internet:</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;It makes it much harder to govern, makes it much harder to organize people, much harder to find the common interest, and that is complicated by a rise of sectarianism and religious extremism that is prepared to employ violent means to impose on other people a way of thinking and a way of living that is completely contrary to everything the United States of America has ever stood for. So we need to keep in mind what our goals are and how complicated this world is that we&#8217;re operating in.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Actually, the Internet makes it easier for people to &#8220;find the common interest.&#8221; Just 20 years ago, it was difficult to find libertarian publications.

Of course, those sites relentlessly criticize him. So I can see why he doesn&#8217;t like it and wants to go back to the days of the Elite controlling information.</p> \\n\\n<p>As to &#8220;a rise of sectarianism and religious extremism,&#8221; there&#8217;s been a lot of that over the ages. Nothing new. But except for North Korea, we no longer have the secular regimes that murdered tens of millions of people in the last century, especially religious people. Even Castro&#8217;s Cuba is pretty tame now. That&#8217;s largely due to the communications revolution. It&#8217;s a lot harder to perpetrate an Auschwitz or a Gulag today because people would write about it on the Internet, and Google Maps would provide satellite pictures.</p> \\n\\n<p>Elitists like Kerry don&#8217;t like losing control. Well, they lost control &#8212; and it&#8217;s gone for good.</p>',\n",

              " 6175: '<p>Late&amp;#160;on an April 2011 evening, 83-year-old Mark Chanko ran across the street from his wife&#8217;s&amp;#160;Manhattan home to pick up some milk and bananas. He was hit by a sanitation&amp;#160;truck and died at NewYork-Presbyterian hospital due to severe injuries. Sixteen months later his widow, Anita Chanko, was shocked to see his death broadcast on an episode of NY Med, the real-life medical series starring Dr. Mehmet Oz.</p> \\n\\n<p>Although Mr. Chanko&#8217;s face was blurred out, his wife could tell is was him, recognizing his voice and the doctor who had treated him. She watched in horror as her husband moaned in pain, emergency room staff said his blood pressure was falling and then pronounced him dead.</p> \\n\\n<p>No one in the family had given permission for NY Med to&amp;#160;film the treatment or broadcast Mr. Chanko&#8217;s&amp;#160;final moments. Under federal privacy rules (HIPAA) the details of a person&#8217;s health are supposed to be shared only with the patient&#8217;s immediate family and whomever they designate.</p> \\n\\n<p>Although ABC quickly removed the episode involving Mr. Chanko, the family sued ABC, NewYork-Presbyterian and Dr. Sebastian Schubl. An appellate panel dismissed the case recently, but the family is appealing. In court filings ABC and the hospital did not dispute the fact that they did not have consent from the Chanko family, but said that since the patient is not identifiable they did&amp;#160;not violate Mr. Chanko&#8217;s privacy. They claim the Chanko family&#8217;s actions in filing the suit have resulted in their loss of privacy.</p> \\n\\n<p>The night of Mr. Chanko&#8217;s accident the couple had just arrived home after spending a few days in Goshen, Conn. Upon discovering that they were out of some basic food items, Mr. Chanko decided to run across York Avenue to a deli. After he had been gone a few minutes the building doorman buzzed Mrs. Chanko and asked her to come downstairs. When she did not immediately respond a neighbor came and got her.</p> \\n\\n<p>When Mrs. Chanko got outside she found an ambulance and her husband on a gurney, with his head bandaged. At the hospital she watched emergency department staff push her husband&amp;#160;inside. She attempted to run up to the gurney to reassure him&amp;#160;but the doctor would not allow it. Dr. Schubl and a social worker came into the conference room at 1:17 a.m. and told the family Mr. Chanko had died.</p> \\n\\n<p>Hospitals are vying to allow television crews to film the action that happens at their facilities as a way to showcase themselves. Medical ethicists and medical professional organizations such as the American Medical Association worry that the shows exploit patients&#8217; pain for entertainment, but the show&#8217;s produceers claim that they educate viewers and even inspire people to choose medical careers. The American College of Emergency Physicians opposes such filming of patients who are unable to give consent.</p> \\n\\n<p>Myrna Manners, NewYork-Presbyterian&#8217;s vice president of public affairs at the time, said &#8220;You can&#8217;t buy this kind of publicity, an eight-part series on a major medical network.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Typically hospitals do not receive money for allowing medical reality shows to film in their facilities. NewYork-Presbyterian also received no compensation for allowing NY Med to work there. The payoff is distinguishing themselves as healthcare leaders.</p> \\n\\n<p>The Chanko family was unaware that the operating room attempts to save the elderly man&#8217;s life were recorded. They were also unaware that the audio of Dr. Schubl breaking the news of Mr. Chanko&#8217;s death was recorded as well.</p> \\n\\n<p>Mr. Chanko&#8217;s son, Kenneth, 57, has filed complaints against ABC, the hospital, the New York State Department of Health, a hospital accrediting group, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&#8217; civil rights office. Officials with the New York state health department concluded that the hospital had violated Mr. Chanko&#8217;s rights, as well as their own privacy policies, but New York regulators imposed no sanctions.</p> \\n\\n<p>A New York State Supreme Court judge allowed some claims to proceed but in November an appellate panel dismissed the case, saying the conduct was not so extreme as to justify a claim of intention infliction of emotional distress. The family is working on an appeal. Kenneth Chanko says that &#8220;morally and ethically it&#8217;s not right.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p />',\n",

              " 6210: \"<p>For years, Bremerton School District assistant football coach Joseph A. Kennedy prayed at the 50-yard-line after football games and before them as well. Students frequently joined him, and he would also give them religiously-oriented motivational speeches. The school district attempted to punish him for doing all of this; he settled for praying alone after the games. But soon enough, he began praying at the 50-yard-line before everyone had gone home.</p> \\n\\n<p>So the school district suspended him, and allowed his contract to expire.</p> \\n\\n<p>Kennedy sued, suggesting religious discrimination under the First Amendment. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals found that the school district had every right to dismiss Kennedy: &#8220;When Kennedy kneeled and prayed on the fifty-yard line immediately after games while in view of students and parents, he spoke as a public employee, not as a private citizen, and his speech therefore was constitutionally unprotected.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Then the Court went further. In a concurrence, one of the judges wrote that the school did the right thing in firing Kennedy.</p> \\n\\n<p>That is insane viewpoint discrimination.</p> \\n\\n<p>Kennedy&#8217;s job included becoming a &#8220;coach, mentor, and role model for student athletes.&#8221; It included an explicit job requirement to attempt to create both good athletes and &#8220;good human beings.&#8221; Kennedy&#8217;s post-game prayers originally lasted a grand total of 30 seconds, and were &#8220;a brief, quiet prayer of thanksgiving for player safety, sportsmanship, and spirited competition.&#8221; Over time, they morphed into motivational speeches given to students of both teams &#8212; students who voluntarily wanted to hear him.</p> \\n\\n<p>The District suggested that these activities violated school board policy that said &#8220;staff shall neither encourage nor discourage a student from engaging in non-disruptive oral or silent prayer or any other form of devotional activity.&#8221; There is no evidence that Kennedy pushed students into anything; the school board even acknowledged as much. But the school board insisted that Kennedy not allow students to pray with him at all &#8212; that any activity had to be &#8220;physically separate from any student activity, and students may not be allowed to join such activity.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Kennedy eventually agreed to engage in a prayer on the 50-yard-line by himself, but students and spectators spontaneously joined him. Naturally, Satanists &#8212; being good Satanists &#8212; then suggested that they wanted their own right to pray on the field. The district responded by telling Kennedy that he had to pray only when the stadium was empty. Kennedy disobeyed and prayed immediately after games anyway; the district notified him of violation and suspended him, and eventually fired him.</p> \\n\\n<p>The Court found in favor of the district. They made two legal arguments. First, they said that Kennedy was acting as a public employee, and that he therefore could be disciplined under that rubric:</p> \\n\\n<p>Kennedy spoke as a public employee, not as a private citizen &#8230; the &#8216;speech at issue&#8217; is directed at least in part to the students and surrounding spectators; it is not solely speech directed to God. ... All told, by kneeling and praying on the fifty-yard line immediately after games, Kennedy was fulfilling his professional responsibility to communicate demonstratively to students and spectators. Yet, he &#8220;took advantage of his position to press his particular views upon the impressionable and captive minds before him.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Secondly, the Court made clear that it approved the district&#8217;s logic &#8212; that it wanted religious exercise banned so long as it exerted any influence on anyone. Judge Milan D. Smith, Jr. wrote in concurrence:</p> \\n\\n<p>The context would bolster the perception that the District was endorsing religion. ... Irrespective of the District's views on that matter, a reasonable observer would conclude in light of the history and context surrounding Kennedy's conduct that the District, &#8220;in actuality,&#8221; favors religion, and prefers Christianity in particular.</p> \\n\\n<p>Now, teachers don&#8217;t have the absolute right to do and say what they want as employees of school districts. Did the school district have the right to fire Kennedy? Perhaps so. But to suggest that public schools have an obligation to fire those like Kennedy is a despicable, purposeful misreading of the First Amendment, and a blow at Christianity more generally. Kennedy forced no one; his religious practice inspired many. That&#8217;s something good. But for the Left, even the presence of religion in any decent light must be proscribed on the public dollar. The Founders would have been appalled by such nonsense.</p>\",\n",
              " 6229: '<p>The biggest story of the 2008 campaign so far may not be the fall or rise of any candidate, but the quick and quiet decline of the war on terror as a bone of political contention. Supposedly, the terror war is yesterday\\'s news, and in any case a losing issue for the Republicans in 2008. Yet this newly congealing conventional wisdom is mistaken. Republicans can win this election on national security. In fact, with its <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10608425\" type=\"external\">cover story</a> this week, The Economist has dropped the winning argument into Republican laps, if only we have the guts and smarts to use it.</p> \\n\\n<p>The success of the surge and the media\\'s aversion to that success have driven Iraq from the front pages. Putting aside the question of media bias, the fact is, Americans are weary of Iraq, and tired as well of our internal battles over the war. The public may be relieved at Iraq\\'s comparative turnaround, yet there\\'s still a feeling that the war was a mistake &#8212; or at least enough of a problem to cast doubt on hawkish solutions.</p> \\n\\n<p>Still, the public worries about the perilous state of the world. The assassination of Benazir Bhutto and the vision of a chaotic, nuclear-armed Pakistan falling into Islamist hands electrified Americans and reminded them of the stakes in the overall war against terror. The public understands that Islamist extremism in a world of nuclear proliferation is still the greatest threat to our safety. Even so, Americans remain weary of what seem like ill-chosen battles, and eager for a break from having to think about war at all. That is the reality of our current mood &#8212; which doesn\\'t mean the war can\\'t return as an issue, only that there has to be a good reason.</p> \\n\\n<p>Well, there is a good reason, and it\\'s called Iran. Of course, last December\\'s National Intelligence Estimate (NIE), by claiming that Iran has long-since abandoned its nuclear weapons program, effectively took the Bush administration\\'s military option in Iran off the table, thereby letting the air out of national security as a campaign issue. Rudy Giuliani\\'s ill-fated release of a campaign ad on the Iranian threat, just as the NIE report broke, marked the moment of political transition. Since then, Iran has been AWOL from our public debates, and with it the most fateful and pressing decision in the broader war against terror.</p> \\n\\n<p>There\\'s just one problem. The NIE report is misleading and mendacious nonsense. What\\'s more, our very hardly-neocon European allies are just now waking up to that fact. The Economist\\'s &#8220;Has Iran Won?&#8221; cover story (consisting of both an opinion piece and an extended issue briefing) makes it clear that the clean bill of health so misleadingly granted Iran by the NIE has effectively unraveled five years of painstaking European diplomacy. According to The Economist, the NIE report was a huge mistake &#8212; an intellectually distorted product that has not only left Europe\\'s diplomats angry and despondent but has killed the once genuine prospect of cooperation from Russia and China, and left Iran in position for a nuclear breakout during the next presidential term. The title of The Economist\\'s extended analysis gives a feel for this remarkable <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10601584\" type=\"external\">cover story</a>: &#8220;As the enrichment machines spin on: How America\\'s own intelligence services have brought international policy on Iran to the edge of collapse.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The emerging diplomatic disaster spawned by the NIE report, which is increasingly recognized as misleading, raises the prospect of flipping the current political dynamic. The NIE had seemed to confirm the dovish Democratic line: Fears of Iran are greatly exaggerated. So let\\'s drop our guns, hand the problem back to the diplomats (especially those helpful Europeans), and concentrate on domestic issues instead.</p> \\n\\n<p>Yet, as the truth about the NIE report emerges from decidedly non-neocon sources like The Economist, it\\'s increasingly clear that the real NIE story is actually a Republican warning come true. Dovish intelligence analysts eager to discredit the administration and tie its hands have not only distorted and betrayed the truth about Iran, they have undercut and infuriated the very European diplomats America\\'s doves look to for approval and assistance. The NIE lied. Europe\\'s peacemakers cried. Seizing on this story could bring national security back into the heart of this election campaign &#8212; and for all the right reasons.</p> \\n\\n<p>No one\\'s saying the NIE\\'s author\\'s intended to harm America or to help Iran get the bomb. This is more a &#8220;shoot-yourself-in-the-foot&#8221; narrative than a &#8220;stab-in-the-back&#8221; one, where ham-handed attempts by dovish bureaucrats to influence policy ended up distorting intelligence and inadvertently harming the West\\'s diplomatic efforts. The Economist calls the NIE an &#8220;own goal,&#8221; as when a soccer player accidentally scores against his own team. The upshot is that it\\'s not the hawks, but bureaucratic doves, who can justly be accused of distorting intelligence for political reasons. Nor is The Economist shy about pointing up how Democrats have foolishly allowed their opposition to the president to play into Iranian hands: &#8220;Presuming Mr. Bush\\'s guns to be now truly spiked, his critics at home are cheering along with the Iranians.&#8221; Up to now, the NIE report has killed Iran as a campaign issue. Yet The Economist\\'s cover story shows that the NIE report itself is the issue &#8212; and a winning one for Republicans.</p> \\n\\n<p /> \\n\\n<p>Calling for a preemptive strike on Iran may be a losing political play right now &#8212; but the Republican nominee need not do that. Yes, we\\'ve got to put at least the possibility of a strike against Iran back on the table. Keeping the military option alive is actually the best way to stop Iran\\'s bomb, short of war. This ought to have been obvious before, but it\\'s now been proven in practice. The collapse of our military option in Iran &#8212; thanks to the NIE\\'s distortions &#8212; has destroyed our diplomatic option, as well. That fact creates a genuinely teachable foreign-policy moment.</p> \\n\\n<p>We\\'ve heard it claimed that Europe\\'s vaunted soft power actually depends upon the hard fact of American military protection. Europe\\'s emerging diplomatic disaster on Iran proves it. Take America\\'s military option in Iran off the table, and the Iranians will have their bomb &#8212; quite possibly before the end of the next presidential term. The best way to &#8220;give peace a chance&#8221; in Iran is to keep a realistic threat of war in reserve. A Republican nominee ought to be able to say this, without claiming that war is inevitable. On the contrary, the point is that only a tough stand on force has any hope of solving the crisis by purely diplomatic means.</p> \\n\\n<p>When I hear Democrats enthusing privately about this election, one of their thrills is imagining how impressed our European allies will be to see a bunch of supposed American troglodytes electing a woman or an African-American as president. That\\'ll show those Europeans how sophisticated we are! The problem is that the West doesn\\'t need another Europe. What the West really needs is an American tough cop who can place an iron fist inside Europe\\'s velvet glove. That, of course, is precisely what Republicans supply.</p> \\n\\n<p>Not that The Economist is calling for a tougher Iran policy. On the contrary, exasperated as The Economist may be by the NIE fiasco, the magazine is now seemingly prepared to give away the store. The Economist wants the administration to drop its dema nd that Iran stop enriching uranium before talks get under way, then quickly offer the mullahs a &#8220;grand bargain&#8221; for an overall peace. They remain skeptical of a deal, however, since they grant that Iran is in no mood to negotiate, and is in any case likely to use drawn-out talks as a cover to finish its bomb.</p> \\n\\n<p>Yet it\\'s certainly impressive that so relatively dovish a magazine now confirms conservative complaints about the NIE in every other respect. In contrast to the NIE, The Economist is clear that the real threat from Iran is not the supposedly suspended weaponization program, which can quickly be restarted and completed, but the uranium-enrichment program that Iran is carrying out in open defiance of the world. &#8220;Whether by accident or design,&#8221; says The Economist, &#8220;the [NIE] report was written in such a way that allowed the finding about weaponisation to suck attention away from the uranium work&#8230;.&#8221; The Economist even takes International Atomic Energy Agency head Mohamed El Baradei to task for undercutting U.N. diplomacy, and for perhaps even hiding the truth about Iran\\'s nuclear plans &#8212; all for the sake of frustrating America\\'s hawks. And the magazine\\'s reporting is clearly based on extensive discussions with European diplomats deeply angered by what they view as a seriously distorted and damaging intelligence report.</p> \\n\\n<p>Given this, an aggressive attack on the NIE by the Republican nominee can successfully bring national security back into the center of campaign 2008. Whether the Republican standard-bearer is John McCain or not, the nominee will not have President Bush\\'s credibility problem on intelligence issues. What\\'s more, the demonstrably misleading and diplomatically disastrous NIE will not survive sustained scrutiny. Not only will an aggressive Republican attack on the NIE effectively revive the Iran issue, it will teach a powerful lesson about the dangers of overenthusiastic dovishness.</p> \\n\\n<p>If the Republican nominee does go after the NIE, what will the Democrats say in response? If the Dems defend the report, they\\'ll look bad, because the NIE is in truth deeply misleading and has severely damaged international diplomacy on Iran. Even The Economist says so. National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell <a href=\"http://www.nysun.com/article/70818\" type=\"external\">distanced himself</a> from his own agency\\'s findings just this Tuesday. If, on the other hand, the Democrats should agree that the NIE has some serious problems, Republicans still come out on top.</p> \\n\\n<p>If either Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama agreed with the Republican nominee that the Iranian threat is far more real and proximate than the NIE report implies, that would be major news, and would surely return the Iran issue to the heart of the campaign. The Republican nominee would then have the advantage. Better still, general agreement from both nominees that the NIE report is flawed would simultaneously put the military option back on the table and kick-start our failing efforts to solve the Iran problem without force. That would be very good indeed, and not just for the Republicans, but for the country as a whole.</p> \\n\\n<p>So in effect, the willingness of the Republican nominee to openly and aggressively challenge the NIE report would give a real-time demonstration of how toughness in the war on terror brings results. Whether the Democrats run a &#8220;grand bargain&#8221; strategy or an &#8220;I\\'m tough, too&#8221; gambit in reply, this is a game they can\\'t win.</p> \\n\\n<p>Ultimately, however, the real reason that the NIE report is a winning issue is that the threat of a nuclear Iran is all-too-real. The Economist reports that the Iranians could have enough highly enriched uranium for a bomb by 2009, the very first year of the new president\\'s term, and by 2010&#8211;2015 at the latest. The Iran bomb issue is therefore likely to dominate the next administration. Given that, our presidential nominees have both a right and an obligation to explain how they intend to handle this issue.</p> \\n\\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8212; Stanley Kurtz is a senior fellow at the <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Ethics and Public Policy Center</a> and an NRO contributing editor.</p>',\n",

Their reasons for growing it were sensible enough: hemp offered unparalleled capital potential as a cash crop with its seemingly limitless industrial applications, not to mention its nutritional properties. A couple of centuries and a failed Drug War later, a California state senator is making an effort to revive some of the common sense found in this earlier, agrarian era.</p> \\n\\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>On Tuesday, the California State Senate passed SB 676, Sen. Mark Leno&#8217;s (San Francisco) bill, that would effectively legalize the production of hemp in the state for industrial purposes. Two prior attempts by the senator to regulate hemp production were vetoed by former Governor Schwarzenegger.</p> \\n\\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>This measure would redefine &#8220;marijuana&#8221; to exclude industrial hemp. The new definition for hemp would include non-psychoactive fiber or oilseed crops with no more than 0.3 percent of THC. Crops would have to undergo testing to certify that their THC content was within the legal limit, mimicking established protocol in Canada.</p> \\n\\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>So why is Sen. Leno so bent on legalizing hemp? He expounds on the &#8220;golden opportunity&#8221; hemp offers California in a recent blog post:</p> \\n\\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &#8220;If you like shopping at your local natural foods or specialty grocery store, you&#8217;ve probably noticed the growing popularity of hemp as an ingredient in food and skin care products. Hemp seed, which is high in protein and essential fatty acids, is found in everything from bread, energy bars and waffles to coffee and protein powder. Thanks to its natural antioxidants and moisturizing oil, hemp is also a common ingredient in soaps, shampoos and lotions. Perhaps your favorite T-shirt is even made of hemp, which is an excellent alternative to cotton.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &#8220;Even though most of these consumer products are created by California companies, our farmers are prohibited from growing industrial hemp. Instead of buying hemp from local farmers, local manufacturers are importing thousands of dollars of hemp seed, oil and fiber from growers overseas.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &#8220;California farmers are missing out on a golden opportunity to tap into the growing industrial hemp products business of food, clothing, shelter, paper and fuel, which would greatly benefit our state&#8217;s economy and family farmers. Industrial hemp is a perfect, environmentally sustainable crop for our state. It requires little or no pesticides and herbicides and produces two to four times more fiber than an acre of timber. Hemp grows quickly, can be harvested every 90 days and is a great rotational crop, especially for organic farmers.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>The therapeutic properties of hemp oil alone should be enough to draw serious attention to the issue of hemp legalization. Dr. Udo Erasmus, in his book Fats that Heal &#8211; Fats that Kill, writes:</p> \\n\\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &#8220;Hemp seed oil may be nature&#8217;s most perfectly balanced oil. It contains an ideal 3:1 ratio of omega-6&#8217;s [linoleic acid] to omega-3&#8217;s [alpha-linolenic acid] for long-term use, and provides the omega-6 derivative gamma-linolenic acid (GLA).&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>(On a side note, this author is enjoying a glass of &#8220;hemp milk&#8221; as he writes this article).</p> \\n\\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>Of course, SB 676 faces an uphill legislative battle. Besides the undeserved social stigma carried by the psychedelically- handicapped crop and the powerful lobby opposing it from various industries including lumber, paper, textile, construction material and oil producers, legalized hemp would stand as an enemy within the gates for an unexpected rival: medicinal marijuana. According to Dale Gieringer, state coordinator of Cal NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws), windblown pollen from cannabis plants (this includes hemp) can travel as far as 100 miles. Outdoor sinsemilla crops would be at constant risk of being fertilized &#8211; and thus spoiled &#8211; by nearby industrial hemp because SB 676 places no restrictions on where hemp can be grown.</p> \\n\\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>There is a further problem, critics say. Hemp would remain a schedule I substance under federal laws.</p> \\n\\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>In actuality, the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (CSA) explicitly excludes all hemp-derived products (sterilized hempseed, hempseed oil and hempseed cake) from the definition of &#8220;marijuana&#8221;. This means, technically, that hemp is a federally unregulated crop. The rub is that the DEA has arbitrarily interpreted the CSA to read that &#8220;any substance containing any amount of THC [is] a Schedule I controlled substance even if [it] is made from hemp.&#8221; But hey, these rules haven&#8217;t exactly thwarted California&#8217;s thriving marijuana industry.</p> \\n\\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>Senate Bill 676 still has to be approved by the Assembly and signed by Governor Jerry Brown before it can become California law. The full text of the bill can be found <a href=\"http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen/sb_0651-0700/sb_676_bill_20110218_introduced.html\" type=\"external\">here</a>.</p> \\n\\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>*Editor&#8217;s note: since the time this story was published Leno&#8217;s bill has been amended into a five county pilot program that limits and clearly outlines where industrial hemp cultivation will occur.

Newsom had already spoken and was seated at a table onstage, blushing and shaking his head, as Nadelmann shared his fantasy at a public forum sponsored by the S.F. Medical Society July 26. In the fantasy, after &#8220;very interesting conversations in the White House,&#8221; Newsom must bar the entrance to San Francisco&#8217;s city-run grow op as federal forces approach. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to take me first,&#8221; he declares. (In reality, of course, the dashing young mayor would be surrounded by public health officers, supervisors, deputy sheriffs and citizens en masse.)</p> \\n\\n<p>More than 250 concerned citizens attended the forum, which was held at the Jewish Community Center (where cars get searched before entering the garage and security guards inspect suspicious guitar cases). San Francisco is weighing the regulation of cannabis dispensaries just as the DEA is closing some of them down &#8211; &#8220;a daunting task,&#8221; to put it mildly. Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi has drafted an ordinance that would require dispensaries to pay $7,4000 to apply for several city permits, invite neighbors&#8217; input, and locate at least 500 feet from schools (or 1,000 feet if smoking allowed). An ordinance by Sup. Gerardo Sandoval, would require dispensaries to get a conditional use permit from the Planning Department (a higher bar than Mirkarimi&#8217;s). Both bills involve the keeping of records that could facilitate prosecution by the feds.</p> \\n\\n<p>Here&#8217;s the post-forum commentary of Michael Aldrich, a former club proprietor who has been monitoring the situation closely:</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very concerned that honest patient collectives (not retail stores) get left out of the permit process, which means if passed as written, there will be no way for patient collectives allowed in SB420 to exist in San Francisco! It may be irrelevant anyway, if the Federal injunction allowing WAMM to operate their collective garden, expires this month and is not renewed because of Raich.</p> \\n\\n<p>But I do think that patient collectives that do not have a retail store, that actually reimburse a grower to grow for them, have the right to exist under SB420. The problem with the WAMM model in the City is twofold: first, it&#8217;s hard for them to raise money to recompense the grower, unless the grower also sells to retail stores and just gives it away to some patients&#8230; Second, the difficulty with inspecting and zoning hidden gardens without going through the public notification process our collective can&#8217;t even apply for a permit because we&#8217;d have to find $7400 just for the permit application fee. Then going through the process, pay lawyers (or professional Zoning helpers, as one dispensary did), post big signs outside saying HEY THE POT FARM&#8217;S OVER HERE, so all the neighbors can object and the DEA doesn&#8217;t even have to subpoena records or anything, just go wherever the permit process is happening and pound on the door. Then there&#8217;s the &#8220;open books&#8221; public inspection process for &#8220;clubs,&#8221; which again gives the Feds free reign without even subpoena&#8217;ing records because they&#8217;re public record&#8230; Mirkarimi&#8217;s bill seems to say, in fact, that the only gardens permitted are inside the clubs and not outside gardens. Since only dispensaries with permits are legal, how is a patient collective supposed to get a permit for a garden?</p> \\n\\n<p>Which is more defensible in court&#8211; a collective with no retail sales, or a retail store very much involved in commerce? Perhaps neither. Both will be portrayed in Federal court as Money Laundering conspiracies (i.e. if you plow your proceeds back into the operation with services for patients, all the money you spend for cost of goods or services or fixing the place up or giving away to people in hospitals&#8211; that&#8217;s what the Feds are calling money laundering). And remember the Federal courts do not allow mention of &#8220;medical&#8221; in the trial. What a stacked deck! This is justice?</p> \\n\\n<p>Ironically, CHAMP met all the requirements for an MCD in the Mirkarimi bill, we were a patient collective, registered as a nonprofit corporation in California (no 501-C-3), and offering social services for patients every day, staff trained in CPR and harm reduction, friendly neighbor policy, hospital and hospice delivery, ventilation, we put $100,000 into rebuilding the interior to reduce mold, noise, smells, et cetera. We had permits (except I couldn&#8217;t get a business tax certificate) and were members of the Chamber of Commerce, the lowest prices of any club open at the time, and our own private garden to make prices even cheaper. I never measured whether we were within 1000 feet of a school or any cultural or community center. We were a community center for patients and they loved us for that. The proudest day I spent at CHAMP was September 11, 2001, when more than a hundred worried patients jammed into CHAMP all day, watching the buildings collapse. These were mostly people who literally had no where else to go, we fed them, played nice music (TV sound off), and so forth. And many days CHAMP functioned as a day care center for homeless and indigent patients. And we paid our taxes accurately and honestly. I probably would have opened the books to City inspectors, because we felt fairly secure when the District Attorney himself visited and even brought other DA&#8217;s to CHAMP to show them what a good facility looks like.

The evidence obtained by lying was then presented to a Seattle Grand Jury, which issued a sealed indictment last May&#8230; this attack has been planned for at least a year.</p> \\n\\n<p>Presumably, DEAland will now seek to extradite our friends, which will quickly become a major strain on DEAland/Canadian relations.

Wolfe, a historian of Cold War science, nuclear scientists can help defuse tensions during diplomatic crises. &#8220;Scientists can remind the president of the very real damages that those kinds of weapons can do,&#8221; she said in an interview. &#8220;They can be a voice of reason. They can point to evidence.

To this day, the community of nuclear scientists is tight-knit and international. &#8220;So one of the things that they can do is to continue to talk to each other, and keep the channels of communication open, in the event of a crisis.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>In recent years, American and Russian nuclear scientists have grown apart, partly thanks to disagreements about the crises in Ukraine and Syria. That&#8217;s made it harder for the two groups to communicate and collaborate.</p> \\n\\n<p>Wolfe said that some &#8220;optimists&#8221; believe relations will improve under President-elect Trump, who has in the past spoken positively of Russian President&amp;#160;Vladimir Putin. Wolfe was skeptical, however. &#8220;My personal opinion is that that kind of optimism may be short-sighted,&#8221; she said.</p> \\n\\n<p>Given the tensions between Russia and the US, and the fact that nine nations now have nuclear weapons, &#8220;science diplomacy&#8221; seems as timely today as it was in the Cold War.</p> \\n\\n<p>When scientists have the ear of politicians, &#8220;they can be a voice of reason,&#8221; Wolfe said. &#8220;They can point to evidence. They can talk about radiation, they can talk about fallout.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>In the end, though, nuclear weapons are the responsibility of the commander-in-chief. If a US&amp;#160;president decides to order a nuclear strike, there&#8217;s little that scientists &#8212; or anyone else &#8212; can do to stop it.</p>',\n",

              " 6331: '<p>These days one can sense a palpable fear among Republicans that the 2012 presidential election is slipping through their fingers. Their constellation of concerns includes the (perceived) weaknesses of the two frontrunners, Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich; the increasing ferocity of their clash; the public&#8217;s antipathy toward Congress (including the GOP-controlled House); and a slight uptick in the economy (including a drop in the unemployment rate), which is redounding to the benefit of the incumbent. Barack Obama may be a lousy president, the argument goes, but he&#8217;s a very good campaigner.</p> \\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s certainly true that the president is in better shape now than he was just this fall. His approval ratings have nudged up a bit. The country is less pessimistic than it was. And consumer confidence is the highest it&#8217;s been since last April. Still, the incumbent remains exceedingly vulnerable.</p> \\n\\n<p>For example, the president&#8217;s Gallup approval-disapproval ratio is 43 percent to 49 percent, which would translate into a huge defeat for Obama on Election Day. His standing in a dozen key swing states is lower than his standing nationally. And there&#8217;s more. An Allstate/National Journal Heartland Monitor poll taken in December found that just 35 percent of whites say they approve of Obama&#8217;s performance. Among whites without a college education, fewer than one-third approve. And among college-educated white voters, who have generally been favorably disposed to Obama, just 39 percent say they approve. Even among college-educated white women, who gave Obama 52 percent of their votes in 2008, his approval rating has dropped to 42 percent.</p> \\n\\n<p>The president is also near a low point with independents, with only 38 percent approving of his performance. Ronald Brownstein of National Journal points out that President Obama&#8217;s approval rating has dropped 14percentage points from his 2008 level among independents; 12 percentage points among young adults (aged 18-29); 11 points among African Americans; 10 points among college-educated white women; and 7 points among families earning between $75,000 and $100,000.</p> \\n\\n<p>In addition, only 28 percent said they expect Obama&#8217;s policies to increase the opportunity for them to get ahead; 37percent say his agenda will diminish their opportunities. &#8220;That&#8217;s the biggest tilt toward the negative that the poll has ever recorded on this question,&#8221; according to Brownstein. When asked if they intend to vote for Obama, 39 percent said they were now inclined to, while 54 percent said they will definitely or probably back someone else.</p> \\n\\n<p>As for the mood of the nation, the most recent ABC News/Washington Post poll finds that two-thirds (68 percent) say the country&#8217;s on the wrong track, 6 points higher than a year ago. Fewer than half as many, 30 percent, say it&#8217;s headed in the right direction. And on the most important polling question of all, the president&#8217;s handling of the economy, Obama has a dangerously low 41 percent approval rating. Only 9 percent of Americans see a strong economic recovery. Twice as many say they are worse off financially since Obama became president than say their situations have improved. And more than half the respondents&#8212;52 percent&#8212;say Obama has accomplished &#8220;not much&#8221; or &#8220;little or nothing&#8221; as president.</p> \\n\\n<p>No historical comparison works perfectly, of course, but the situation we&#8217;re in resembles nothing so much as 1980, at least in this regard. By the fourth year of his presidency, the public had concluded that Jimmy Carter was a failed president. The economy was in very bad shape, his policies were unpopular, and the nation was in a funk.</p> \\n\\n<p>The public&#8217;s verdict on Carter wasn&#8217;t impulsive or easy to undo. It was, in fact, a perfectly reasonable assessment based on his almost four years at the helm. As a result, most Americans were disposed to vote him out of office. The question was whether Ronald Reagan would provide enough of them sufficient reassurance to vote for him.</p> \\n\\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t always clear he would. Many forget that Reagan was savagely attacked by Carter as a racist, a warmonger, and indifferent to the poor. Those attacks took their toll. Only nine days before the election, the Gallup organization showed Carter with a 3-point lead.</p> \\n\\n<p>Then came the October 28, 1980, debate in Cleveland. It was on that stage that Reagan once and for all shattered Carter&#8217;s myth of Reagan. The Gipper gave a majority of Americans all the confidence they needed to vote for him, and they did, in an overwhelming fashion.</p> \\n\\n<p>To be clear: There are important differences between Barack Obama and Jimmy Carter, and the eventual Republican nominee, whoever he is, will be no Ronald Reagan. But where the 2012 race resembles the 1980 race is that the public, which still likes Obama personally for the most part, is very much inclined to vote him out of office. They believe he&#8217;s overmatched by events.</p> \\n\\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean the GOP nominee will win the presidency in 2012. It only means he should.</p> \\n\\n<p>Peter Wehner is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.</p>',\n",
              " 6360: '<p>Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the UK&#8217;s Labour Party, has made a remarkable comeback after his political obituary had been written and widely accepted as recently as seven weeks ago. Although the Tories, led by Theresa May, will still have the largest number of seats, they have lost their majority, after calling the election in the belief that they would increase it. Labour has picked up at least 29 seats. The result is a hung parliament, and it is not yet clear whether a coalition government will be formed or new elections will have to be held.</p> \\n\\n<p>Observers have pointed to various historical causes that have brought Corbyn to his leadership position and kept him there, such as the failure of the centrist, neoliberal project of &#8220;New Labour&#8221; to provide economic security or even much of a future for the party&#8217;s working class base; or Tony Blair&#8217;s deeply unpopular foreign policy, including the Iraq War and the lies on which it was sold.</p> \\n\\n<p>Many have made the comparison to Bernie Sanders, who despite losing his primary bid last year is currently the&amp;#160; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">most popular</a>&amp;#160;active politician in the US, and is especially well-liked among younger people. The appeal of these two senior citizens to youth is striking, and it bodes well for the future.</p> \\n\\n<p>But one of the most important lessons of the Corbyn comeback is that the truth, so often dismissed as the first casualty of politics, can be an effective weapon. After the Manchester terrorist attack, Corbyn&amp;#160; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">said&amp;#160;</a>something that no party leader in the US would say during an election campaign:</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Many experts, including professionals in our intelligence and security services, have pointed to the connections between wars our government has supported or fought in other countries and terrorism here at home.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Corbyn opposed UK involvement in the wars in Afghanistan, Libya, Iraq, and Syria.</p> \\n\\n<p>British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a Trump-like buffoonish character with the moral compass of a sewer rat, responded in character, saying that Corbyn&#8217;s statement was &#8220;absolutely monstrous&#8221; and that it was &#8220;extraordinary and inexplicable in this week of all weeks that there should be any attempt to justify or to legitimate the actions of terrorists in this way.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>But these dishonest attacks, echoed by some of the UK&#8217;s largest media outlets, didn&#8217;t stick, because people knew that Corbyn was telling the truth. A&amp;#160; <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-poll-foreign-policy-terrorism-british-voters-agree-majority-latest-a7776276.html?amp\" type=\"external\">poll</a>&amp;#160;this week for The Independent in the UK found 75 percent in agreement that &#8220;interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya have made atrocities on UK soil more likely.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>There is an important lesson here: the only way to prevent the right from constantly capitalizing on, and perpetuating, the cycle of terrorism and foreign military intervention is to explain to people what is actually happening.</p> \\n\\n<p>President Obama actually said it for a few seconds in an&amp;#160; <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/video/president-obama-speaks-with-vice-news\" type=\"external\">interview</a>&amp;#160;with Vice News back in March 2015:</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;ISIL is direct outgrowth of al-Qaeda in Iraq, which grew out of our invasion.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>But the major media looked the other way; in the US, it was the more right-wing outlets and blogs who took note because they thought it was scandalous and would hurt Obama.</p> \\n\\n<p>Of course Obama could have gone further and explained that al-Qaeda itself, including Osama bin Laden, was a product of billions of dollars of US support for jihadists in Afghanistan in the 1980s; not to mention Washington&#8217;s close alliance with what&amp;#160; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">remains</a>&amp;#160;the ideological center and major financier of Islamic extremism: Saudi Arabia.</p> \\n\\n<p>Few have the courage to say that the West&#8217;s threat from terrorism is overwhelmingly blowback from its interventions, because they are afraid of responses like those of Boris Johnson and the UK media. But it needs to be said here too, not least because the &#8220;War on Terror&#8221; is the last refuge for discredited, right-wing politicians like Donald Trump, who is otherwise on the road to self-destruction. Republicans used the build-up to the Iraq War to keep the US Congress in 2002; and despite the fact that the war was already a disastrous failure by 2004, it helped George W. Bush get re-elected.</p> \\n\\n<p>The &#8220;Labour Manifesto&#8221; was also an act of courage, sticking to the principles of economic and social justice that had long motivated the party&#8217;s base as well as most of its voters. It proposed a substantial expansion of the national health service, government-provided child care, labor rights legislation to increase the bargaining power of workers, prevented increases in the retirement age, and increased public investment. Taxes on corporations, high-income earners, and financial transactions would be increased to pay for new social spending.</p> \\n\\n<p>As with Bernie Sanders&#8217; proposals for free college tuition, universal health care, and taxes on Wall Street, it has been a mass movement led by younger people that put these popular reforms on the political map.</p> \\n\\n<p>The UK election also unfortunately shows the power that the mass media has over what many people think, and therefore over electoral possibilities. In the US, the major media helped keep Bernie from the Democratic nomination mostly by giving him relatively little coverage. The UK media, especially the newspapers read by millions, are more aggressively partisan and they have engaged in a war of character assassination against Corbyn. By April 18, when Prime Minister Theresa May announced the elections, the media had almost succeeded in finishing off Corbyn and ensuring a Tory landslide.</p> \\n\\n<p>What gave Corbyn new life was partly the Labour Manifesto, which allowed many voters to see that he stood for things that they believed in. And he also got a boost from electoral laws regulating the TV media that kicked in at the beginning of May. These are intended to give equal television time to the contending parties.</p> \\n\\n<p>We will need a more fair and impartial media in the US, among other&amp;#160; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">reforms</a>, if we are going to move toward a more democratic political system. But the most important lesson from the UK election is that some of the most important truths that the media won&#8217;t touch are not necessarily to be feared by genuine political leaders.</p> \\n\\n<p>This article originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com\" type=\"external\">Huffington Post</a>.</p>',\n",

Mr. Advani, for those who don&#8217;t follow Indian politics, is not only the president of India&#8217;s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the tallest idealogue of the Hindutva movement, but its most intelligent expositor. After a four-decade career bashing muslims, stoking the fires of divisiveness with a &#8216;Rath Yatra&#8217;, being very much on the scene when the Babri Masjid mosque was forcibly torn down in defiance of court orders, all capped by his chilling silence (of little account whether deliberate or impotent) as Home Minister when the Gujarat pogroms took place in 2002, Advani, now leader of the Opposition in India&#8217;s parliament, was in Pakistan for a visit last week.</p> \\n\\n<p>Now Pakistan may be justly accused of many things by Indians, but lack of hospitality is not among them. Every Indian who has visited Pakistan, to a man (or woman), remembers being overwhelmed by the genuine warmth shown by all levels of society, particularly the ordinary citizen of Pakistan.</p> \\n\\n<p>In Advani&#8217;s case, he was also going back home, in a sense. Born in Karachi, he spent the first 20 years of his life in that city before migrating across the new international border following the Partition. Now, at 78, he was visiting the place where his old home stood, his school, his old haunts, afloat upon an outpouring of affection which he had no cause to expect.</p> \\n\\n<p>The trifecta of holiday spirit, hospitality and nostalgia doubtless served to infuse Mr. Advani, even amidst the worst communal horror the very picture of urbanity, with the added virtue of benevolence.</p> \\n\\n<p>Thus it was, like Gussie Fink Nottle addressing the kids at the Market Snodsbury Grammar School, that Mr. Advani laid forth some observations that both astonished his hosts in Pakistan and horrified his cohorts in India. He quoted Mohammad Ali Jinnah &#8212; bad enough, but worse was to come. He quoted Jinnah extolling secularism! Pakistan would be a secular country, Jinnah said, where the state would have nothing to do with religion. Had Advani merely said that this was what Pakistan should live up to, he would have made an intelligent debating point, no more.</p> \\n\\n<p>But he went beyond that. He added that this should be the ideal to which India, Pakistan and Bangladesh should all aspire!</p> \\n\\n<p>Considering that it came at the end of a holocaust which caused a million deaths and several million to migrate, Jinnah&#8217;s speech (see <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">The House that Jinnah Built</a>) was an exercise in pure hypocrisy, but ripe stuff nonetheless (see quote at top). Fink Nottle at least had, in Wodehouse&#8217;s words, &#8216;the old familiar juice &#8230; plashing up against the back of the front teeth&#8217;. Advani though, is a teetotaler, which may go to show the narcotic power of emotion.</p> \\n\\n<p>It might well have been that Advani was trying to point out the common heritage of all three countries in the subcontinent which made up undivided India, a statesmanlike approach. On the other hand, true, Jinnah&#8217;s fine words could apply to India too, but why class India in with Pakistan, where people can be jailed for saying, &#8220;Assalam Alaikum&#8221; if they happen to belong to the wrong religion?</p> \\n\\n<p>Besides, Mr. Advani was contradicting his own logic further, because he added that he was moved to quote Jinnah&#8217;s speech, partly because he had been called upon to lay the foundation stone of the reconstruction of an old Hindu temple in Punjab &#8212; and he was particularly gratified by the fact that the Pakistan government was carrying out this project! And isn&#8217;t this precisely the kind of &#8216;help&#8217; given to Muslims by the Indian state that has got Advani&#8217;s irish up so often in India?</p> \\n\\n<p>And then there was the matter of the guest book entry at the Jinnah mausoleum. Here, Advani praised Jinnah as a man who had changed history by creating Pakistan single-handed, as an ardent secularist, etc. etc. Now it would be one thing to recall Jinnah&#8217;s early contributions to secularism, and his beginnings as an &#8220;Ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity&#8221;. But by rendering such a judgement on Jinnah&#8217;s entire life, the last decade and half of which was almost wholly devoted to communal causes, Advani had caused a huge polemical logjam for his party.</p> \\n\\n<p>The Bharatiya Janata Party and its family of organizations (called the Sangh Family, or Sangh Parivar) had one emotional strong point. They projected the Partition of India as a yet to be remedied wound, a sentiment many in India conceptually accept, even while being aware of its practical infeasibility. Advani quickly knocked the ground from under a half-century old edifice, when he declared that Partition was an accepted fact, and no one could undo it.</p> \\n\\n<p>So it was that Advani&#8217;s continuing reveries and revelations of heart while in Pakistan caused the saffron ayatollahs in the Sangh Parivar to reach for the chooran (the Ayurvedic Maalox). Some, like the weasel Yashwant Sinha, a BJP neophyte, took this opportunity to pounce on Advani even while the latter was still abroad. Several lesser lights used stronger language, the epithet, &#8216;traitor&#8217;, featuring prominently.</p> \\n\\n<p>The morning after he reached New Delhi, Advani drove over to the home of his party&#8217;s secretary and handed him his resignation from the presidentship of the party. For some reason, he found it necessary to mention to the press that he had written his letter the previous night in Karachi itself.</p> \\n\\n<p>For the articulate man who had attacked Pakistan daily over a period of four decades, Advani seemed strangely conciliatory right from the start of his visit. He talked of a different Musharraf. He talked of a changed atmosphere in Pakistan (for the better). He talked of &#8216;waging peace&#8217;.</p> \\n\\n<p>There is much to be criticized in Mr. Advani&#8217;s career, and god knows there is enough in Jinnah&#8217;s. But we can take the wisdom of someone&#8217;s words even if the person does not himself follow that wisdom. Thus, Advani was correct in saying that Jinnah&#8217;s speech of August 11, 1947 provided a fine definition of secularism, which all three countries of the subcontinent would do well to follow.</p> \\n\\n<p>There is some bitter irony in seeing a man responsible for so much misery and misunderstanding called to account when he was building bridges instead. But in inadvertantly sacrificing himself in this manner, Advani may have done more for Pakistani secularism than his half-century of attack politics.</p> \\n\\n<p>So cheer up, Mr. Advani. As a movie critic of old, you will appreciate this paraphrase: &#8220;We&#8217;ll always have Karachi&#8221;.</p> \\n\\n<p>NIRANJAN RAMAKRISHNAN is a writer living on the West Coast.

The intercepted telephone call between US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and the US Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt reveals the two coup plotters discussing which of Washington&#8217;s stooges will be installed as Washington&#8217;s person in the new puppet government.&amp;#160; The intercepted telephone call between Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet and EU foreign policy official Catherine Ashton revealed suspicions, later confirmed by independent reports, that the sniper fire that killed people on both sides of the Kiev protests came from the Washington-backed side of the conflict.</p> \\n\\n<p>To summarize, when Washington orchestrated in 2004 the &#8220;Orange Revolution&#8221; and the revolution failed to deliver Ukraine into Western hands, Washington, according to Victoria Nuland, poured $5 billion into Ukraine over the next ten years.&amp;#160; The money went to politicians, whom Washington groomed, and to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that operate as educational, pro-democracy, and human rights groups, but in fact are Washington&#8217;s fifth columns.</p> \\n\\n<p>When President Yanukovych, after considering the costs and benefits, rejected the invitation for Ukraine to join the European Union, Washington sent its well-funded NGOs into action.&amp;#160; Protests broke out in Kiev demanding that Yanukovych change his decision and join the EU.</p> \\n\\n<p>These protests were peaceful, but soon ultra-nationalists and neo-nazis appeared and introduced violence into the protests. The protest demands changed from &#8220;join the EU&#8221; to &#8220;overthrow Yanukovych and his government.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Political chaos ensued.&amp;#160; Washington installed a puppet government, which Washington represented as a democratic force against corruption.&amp;#160; However, the ultra-nationalists and neo-nazis, such as the Right Sector, began intimidating members of Washington&#8217;s&amp;#160;stooge government.&amp;#160; Perhaps in response, Washington&#8217;s stooges began issuing threats against the Russian speaking population in Ukraine.</p> \\n\\n<p>Areas of southern and eastern Ukraine are former Russian territories added to Ukraine by Soviet leaders.&amp;#160; Lenin added Russian areas to Ukraine in early years of the Soviet Union, and Khrushchev added Crimea in 1954.&amp;#160; The people in these Russian areas, alarmed by the destruction of Soviet war memorials commemorating the Red Army&#8217;s liberation of Ukraine from Hitler, by the banning of Russian as an official language, and by physical assaults on Russian-speaking people in Ukraine broke out in protests.&amp;#160; Crimea voted its independence and requested reunification with Russia, and so have the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.</p> \\n\\n<p>Washington, its EU puppets, and the Western media have denied that the votes in Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk are sincere and spontaneous.&amp;#160; Instead, Washington alleges that the protests leading to the votes and the votes themselves were orchestrated by the Russian government with the use of bribes, threats, and coercion.&amp;#160; Crimea was said to be a case of Russian invasion and annexation.</p> \\n\\n<p>These are blatant lies, and the foreign observers of the elections know it, but they have no voice in the Western media, which is a Ministry of Propaganda for Washington. Even the once proud BBC lies for Washington.</p> \\n\\n<p>Washington has succeeded in controlling the explanation of the &#8220;Ukrainian crisis.&#8221;&amp;#160; The unified peoples in Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk have been branded &#8220;terrorists.&#8221;&amp;#160; In contrast, the Ukrainian neo-nazis have been elevated to membership in the &#8220;democratic coalition.&#8221;&amp;#160; Even more amazing, the neo-nazis are being described in the Western media as &#8220;liberators&#8221; of the protest regions from &#8220;terrorists.&#8221;&amp;#160; Most likely, the Russophobic neo-nazi militias are becoming Washington&#8217;s stooge government&#8217;s army, because so many units of the Ukrainian military have been unwilling to fire on peaceful protestors.</p> \\n\\n<p>The question before us is how will Russia&#8217;s leader, President Putin, play this game. His hesitancy or reluctance to accept Donetsk and Luhansk again as part of Russia is used by the Western media to make him look weak and intimidated. Within Russia this will be used against Putin by Washington-funded GGOs and by Russian nationalists.</p> \\n\\n<p>Putin understands this, but Putin also understands that Washington wants him to confirm their demonized portrait of him.&amp;#160; If Putin&amp;#160;accepts requests from Donetsk and Luhansk to return to Russia, Washington will repeat its allegation that Russia&amp;#160;invaded and annexed.&amp;#160; Most likely, Putin is not weak and intimidated, but for good reasons Putin does not want to give Washington more propaganda to employ in Europe.</p> \\n\\n<p>Washington&#8217;s press for sanctions against Russia has an obstacle in Germany. The German Chancellor, Merkel, is Washington&#8217;s vassal, but Germany&#8217;s foreign Minister, Frank Walter Steinmeier and German industry are no friends of sanctions.&amp;#160; In addition to Germany&#8217;s dependence on natural gas from Russia, thousands of German companies are doing business in Russia, and the employment of several hundred thousands of Germans is dependent on economic relations with Russia.&amp;#160; Former German Chancellors Helmut Schmidt and Gerhard Schroeder have slammed Merkel for her subservience to Washington. Merkel&#8217;s position is weak, because she has stupidly put herself in the position of sacrificing the interests of Germany to Washington&#8217;s interests.</p> \\n\\n<p>Putin, who has demonstrated that he is not the typical dumb Western politician, sees in the conflict between Washington&#8217;s pressure on Germany and Germany&#8217;s real interests a chance to break up NATO and the EU.&amp;#160; If Germany decides, as Yanukovych did, that Germany&#8217;s interests lie in its economic relations with Russia, not in being a puppet state of Washington, can Washington overthrow the government of Germany and install a more reliable puppet?</p> \\n\\n<p>Perhaps Germany has had enough of Washington.&amp;#160; Still occupied by Washington&#8217;s troops 69 years after the end of World War II, Germany has had its educational practices, its history, its foreign policy, and its membership in the EU and euro mechanism coerced by Washington.&amp;#160; If Germans have any national pride, and as a very recently unified peoples, they might still have some national pride, these impositions by Washington are too much to accept.</p> \\n\\n<p>The last thing Germany wants is a confrontation, economic or military, with Russia. Germany&#8217;s vice chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, said that it &#8220;was certainly not smart to create the impression in Ukraine that it had to decide between Russia and the EU.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>If the Russian government decides that Washington&#8217;s control of Ukraine, or whatever part remains after secession, is an unacceptable strategic threat to Russia, the Russian military will seize Ukraine, historically part of Russia.&amp;#160; If Russia occupies Ukraine, there is nothing Washington can do but resort to nuclear war.&amp;#160; NATO countries, with their own existence at stake, will not agree to this option.</p> \\n\\n<p>Putin can take the Ukraine back whenever he wants and turn his back on the West, a declining corrupt entity mired in depression and looting by the capitalist class.&amp;#160; The 21st century belongs to the East, to China and India.&amp;#160; The enormous expanse of Russia sits above both of these most populous of all countries.</p> \\n\\n<p>Russia can rise to power with the East. There is no reason for Russia to beg the West for acceptance. The bases for US foreign policy are the Brzezinski and Wolfowitz doctrines, which state that Washington must prevent the rise of Russia.&amp;#160; Washington has no good will toward Russia and will hamper Russia at every opportunity. As long as Washington controls Europe, Russia has no prospects of being a part of the West, unless Russia becomes Washington&#8217;s puppet state, like Germany, Britain, and France.</p> \\n\\n<p>This article first appeared in <a href=\"http://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2014/05/22/russia-rise-to-global-power.html\" type=\"external\">Strategic Culture Foundation</a>.</p>',\n",

In more practical terms, Gulen is a 76-year-old Muslim cleric currently residing in rural Pennsylvania. And, as is also well-known, Erdogan has for years been attempting, lobbying and threatening the US in hopes of getting him extradited back to Turkey. This is where Flynn allegedly comes in: reportedly he, and his son, were part of a plan to grab Gulen and deliver him to Turkey in return for $15 millions. To wit:</p> \\n\\n<p>Under the alleged proposal, Mr. Flynn and his son, Michael Flynn Jr., were to be paid as much as $15 million for delivering Fethullah Gulen to the Turkish government, according to people with knowledge of discussions Mr. Flynn had with Turkish representatives. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has pressed the U.S. to extradite him, views the cleric as a political enemy.</p> \\n\\n<p>While this may sound too bizarre to be true &#8211; as are most things involving Turkey&#8217;s cartoonish dictator &#8211; this isn&#8217;t the first time the public has been informed about an alleged plot involving Flynn to kidnap Gulen and rendition him to an isolated Turkish prison island to face charges of orchestrating the July 2016 attempted coup that killed more than 200 Turks.</p> \\n\\n<p>Before entering the Trump administration as the president&#8217;s national security adviser, Flynn was lobbying on behalf of Turkish interests in the US, including on the Gulen issue. The problem is that &#8211; like Manafort and Podesta &#8211; he didn&#8217;t disclose that work until much later, in Flynn&#8217;s case March of this year, well after he was forced out of the White House for misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador.</p> \\n\\n<p>Furthermore, Federal records show that the company, Flynn Intel Group, was paid $530,000 for advocacy work that &#8220;could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.&#8221; He is now facing military, congressional and criminal investigations into allegations that he improperly concealed his financial ties to Turkey and Russia, and into whether the ties played any role in his decisions as the president&#8217;s adviser.</p> \\n\\n<p>More details <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/mueller-probes-flynns-role-in-alleged-plan-to-deliver-cleric-to-turkey-1510309982\" type=\"external\">from the WSJ</a>:</p> \\n\\n<p>Federal Bureau of Investigation agents have asked at least four individuals about a meeting in mid-December at the &#8216;21&#8217; Club in New York City, where Mr. Flynn and representatives of the Turkish government discussed removing Mr. Gulen, according to people with knowledge of the FBI&#8217;s inquiries. The discussions allegedly involved the possibility of transporting Mr. Gulen on a private jet to the Turkish prison island of Imrali, according to one of the people who has spoken to the FBI.</p> \\n\\n<p>That wasn&#8217;t the first time Flynn allegedly met with representatives of the Turkish government to discuss kidnapping removing Gulen. As former CIA Director James Woolsey told The Wall Street Journal back in March, Woolsey attended another meeting in September where he says he told the group that the plan sounded illegal.</p> \\n\\n<p>Ironically, the Fed&#8217;s interest in whether Flynn was pursuing potentially illegal means to forcibly deal with Gulen indicates that the former Trump adviser faces another investigation stemming from his work on behalf of Turkish government interests, both before and after the presidential election. We say ironically because last time we checked, Turkey is not in Russia, at least not yet according to NATO.</p> \\n\\n<p>Even so, the entire account is based on hearsay:</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;the people who described the alleged proposal said they didn&#8217;t attend the December meeting and didn&#8217;t have direct knowledge from Flynn or his associates about its purported details. It isn&#8217;t clear how advanced Mueller&#8217;s investigation of the alleged plan to remove Gulen is, nor is there any indication that any money changed hands, according to those familiar with the discussions and the FBI investigation.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>In light of the charges against Manafort and Gates, it is also likely that Flynn will face a charge of violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which requires US citizens to disclose when they are acting in the US on behalf of foreign powers. And, like Manafort and Gates, the violations being examined have nothing to do with Flynn&#8217;s work on the Trump campaign or his brief tenure as National Security Adviser. However, like Manafort, Gates, and Papadopoulos, Mueller is working to find any dirt on anyone associated with the campaign in the hopes of flipping them or convincing them to testify against their former boss in exchange for leniency.</p> \\n\\n<p>Until then, look out for more indictments, and &#8211; of course &#8211; the best part: Erdogan&#8217;s angry response which he is never too shy to deliver.</p>',\n",

More study is absolutely necessary to evaluate the value of private school vouchers, just as more study is necessary when it comes to charter schools. But the extant evidence is not good. In fact, if you&#8217;re a champion of vouchers, it&#8217;s downright bad. <a href=\"//www.dispatchpolitics.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2010/09/23/copy/voucher-results-mixed.html?adsec=politics&amp;amp;sid=101\" type=\"external\">Here&#8217;s</a> recent bad news from Ohio. <a href=\"//www.uark.edu/ua/der/SCDP/Milwaukee_Research.html\" type=\"external\">Here&#8217;s</a> bad news from Milwaukee.

When it comes to DC, I personally am disturbed by the lack of quantifiable gains that aren&#8217;t educator dependent&#8212;that is, the fact that graduation rates are significantly higher but testable knowledge is not at least raises fair questions about the pressures for schools receiving vouchers to graduate students even if they have underperformed. (One of the consistent problems with school vouchers is the fact that they directly incentivize schools putting their fingers on the scale, and often with no accountability beyond the honor system.) These are just recent cases, but you can survey the available data and say with little doubt that a compelling empirical case for school vouchers doesn&#8217;t exist.</p> \\n\\n<p>(A bit out of date but good overview on the flagging voucher movement from the Washington Monthly is <a href=\"//www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2008/0804.anrig.html\" type=\"external\">here</a>.)</p> \\n\\n<p>Voucher proponents, in the face of this failure, have to sell hard on the idea of choice.

It&#8217;s all about freedom, giving people choices and making them happier, even if those choices don&#8217;t actually accomplish anything. But is choice in this individualistic sense even a virtue in this case? I would submit that it&#8217;s not, and in fact that it&#8217;s directly opposed to the essential social compact that modern governance relies on.</p> \\n\\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>Consider another public good: public transportation. Here you&#8217;ve got a service provided at low cost to all people that is paid for in part by tax dollars. Think about applying the school voucher model to public transportation. If people could take &#8220;their share&#8221; of the tax dollars that go towards the bus and subway and similar and apply it instead to buying their own car, would that entail choice? Sure. Would it make some people happy? Sure. And it would be a disaster in terms of good governance. It would drastically degrade the service for those who continue to use it, if the service could continue to exist at all. That individuals would have choices and be happy that they have choices is irrelevant if providing those choices hurts a public service that has been enacted through democratic process.</p> \\n\\n<p>No one would entertain the idea of public transport vouchers. Just like no one would entertain the idea of me being able to take &#8220;my share&#8221; of defense spending and say that I&#8217;ll take care of defending myself, thanks. Government expenditure, in schools as well as in transportation and defense, is based on pooled cost and shared spending. Part of the basic logic of vouchers is founded on a phony premise: that if you subtract one student and the portion of a school&#8217;s budget that would be devoted to that student, you&#8217;re having a net zero effect on the school. That simply isn&#8217;t in keeping with the reality of how school budgets operate.</p> \\n\\n<p>As is typical in American political discourse, voucher proponents love to focus on rights. They often talk about parent&#8217;s right to send their kids to whatever school. But of course, parents do have the right to send their children to whatever schools will have them. They just don&#8217;t have the right to use public money to do so, any more than I have the right to take public money to buy a new car. (Not that my 1998 Nissan Sentra is anything less than I dreamed it would be.) We apply voucher logic to literally no other service provided by government, and for good reason. Public services are dependent on shared access, shared costs, and shared accountability. If the public pays for a service, it has the right to run the service and the responsibility to provide oversight for it. If you don&#8217;t like that dynamic, you are essentially objecting to the very idea of taxation and democratic government.</p> \\n\\n<p>You&#8217;ve got to understand all of this as a part of the larger conservative project: undermining all governmental and public ventures, and doing so in large part by degrading the potential for pluralism. Public education is a straightforwardly redistributive program; it&#8217;s a massive government venture; and it has been, recent concern trolling to the contrary, one of the most successful human endeavors of the last several hundred years. The rise of universal public education for all, though still not fully realized, represents one of the greatest improvements in human welfare in history. It&#8217;s no wonder that&amp;#160; this is threatening to conservatives, particularly because teachers are heavily unionized and reliably Democratic.</p> \\n\\n<p>Why is Michelle Rhee <a href=\"//www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/05/09/rhee_scott_walker/index.html\" type=\"external\">a rising star</a> for conservatives? Because she&#8217;s working to undermine what has been on balance a very successful and righteous public program. I recognize that there are a lot of principle people on the left who badly want to reform schools and improve educational outcomes. But I am consistently mystified by how credulous they are about claims made by people who hate a)government programs like public education b)unions and c)Democratic constituencies. Whenever I debate a libertarian about public school reform, I always ask: in your ideal world, would public education exists at all? If they say that they would prefer a pure voucher system where public money finances nothing but private schools, I stop listening. I don&#8217;t take opinions about reforming institutions seriously when the person expressing the opinion actually wants to destroy the institution. I&#8217;m crazy like that.</p> \\n\\n<p>I said before that I think part of the point is not merely to hurt public education in order to move towards a privatized system, but also to erode the foundations of pluralistic society. I think that&#8217;s a big part of this. Public education is, at its heart, a radical and beautiful idea. It&#8217;s not merely that everyone should have access to education, and that we should all pay for it. It&#8217;s the idea that children from across class, racial, ethnic, and other boundaries can come together and work and learn together. They don&#8217;t merely learn the knowledge and skills that school teaches them, but how to operate in a democracy where everyone is not alike. Seeing that a multicultural, pluralistic society can work&#8212;not perfectly, not without angst, not without effort&#8212;is an essential part of a civic education. And that knowledge contributes to the understanding that society is a supporter of individual flourishing, not a threat to it, and that what ultimately benefits the individual is what benefits all of us. Urban people tend to be more liberal in part because they see every day the necessity of people working together to provide for the common welfare, which often means effective government. That in part is what vouchers threaten, as they contribute to the division of children into smaller and smaller subsections where they lack the ability to meaningfully interact with others from across the broad American range of difference, and to see the necessity of shared sacrifice.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all in this together&#8221; is a fundamental liberal insight. It&#8217;s everyone&#8217;s right to send their children off to private school for whatever reason they see fit, and many do so for exclusively enlightened motives. But to say that the public is obligated to pay for it, without real accountability and absent any meaningful evidence of superior outcomes, is nuts.</p>',\n",

She&#8217;s one of the founders of Gun Free UT, a group that sprang up in response to a controversial campus-carry bill <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">that narrowly passed in the state legislature in May</a>. The measure permits the concealed carry of guns in dorms, classrooms, and buildings at state universities and community colleges, while leaving individual schools some latitude to keep parts of their properties firearm-free. The bill, which was signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbot <a href=\"http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2015/06/13/gov-abbott-signs-open-carry-campus-carry-laws-at-shooting-range/\" type=\"external\">at a shooting range</a>, makes Texas the eighth state to allow firearms on campus. (In another 23 states, colleges and universities set rules for themselves, but aren&#8217;t compelled to allow campus carry.)</p> \\n\\n<p>Shortly afterward, Gun Free UT &#8212; which consists of faculty, students, staff, parents, and alumni &#8212; put together a petition on change.org, with the hope of sparking a mass movement against the law. So far, <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/no-guns-in-our-classrooms-gun-free-ut?recruiter=7572902&amp;amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;amp;utm_medium=copylink\" type=\"external\">nearly 2,500 people have signed the petition</a>, and the group has acquired almost 1,000 Facebook followers. About 200 UT faculty members have pledged to refuse guns in their classrooms. UT chancellor&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2015/06/05/412177034/guns-on-texas-campuses-wont-make-them-safer-university-chancellor-says\" type=\"external\">William McCraven, a former Navy Seal,</a>&amp;#160;had earlier&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2015/06/05/412177034/guns-on-texas-campuses-wont-make-them-safer-university-chancellor-says\" type=\"external\">spoken out against the measure</a>, saying,&amp;#160;&#8220;I want to make sure that we make our campuses as safe as possible. And the addition of concealed weapons on campus just [doesn&#8217;t] seem like a good idea to me.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Hundreds of people showed up at Thursday&#8217;s Gun Free UT rally to voice their opposition to the law, which won&#8217;t take effect until August 1, 2016. If nothing else, Moore and the others in Gun Free UT hope to influence how their university system applies the new statute and keep weapons out of classrooms, dorms, and offices. In Moore&#8217;s view, how Texas college leaders sort out those details could lead to a grave shift in how students learn and teachers educate.</p> \\n\\n<p>No, but I&#8217;ve had some experiences that made me very grateful students weren&#8217;t allowed to carry guns on campus. I teach gay and lesbian studies. When I first got here in the early &#8217;90s, I had an office on the ground floor of the English building, and I had a lot of posters up advocating for gay rights. One day, someone broke into the office, burned my gay rights posters, and then wrote &#8220;depravity kills&#8221; all over the windows. It was scary enough for me to know someone was willing to commit a serious act of vandalism. Were it the case that someone could have brought a gun into my office, during office hours, I think I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to do my job.</p> \\n\\n<p>Subscribe to receive The Trace&#8217;s newsletters on important gun news and analysis.</p> \\n\\n<p>More recently, during the semester after the Virginia Tech shootings in 2008, I was teaching an LGBT literature class. Sometimes the class riles up students, and I had a student that semester who believed, among other things, that gay people were going to hell. After a while, I guess as a kind of protest, he started coming to class and lying on the floor. He also started posting things online about not doing the reading and said that he would stop other students from doing the reading. I got nervous and went to my supervisor, and it turned out this student had problems with mental illness and had, in the past, been taken out of other classes. Subsequently, he was removed from my class, and I wound up teaching the rest of the semester in an undisclosed location, with an armed guard stationed nearby.</p> \\n\\n<p>The classroom is a safe space, and we need security there. We need to be able to provide an atmosphere in which young people can become uncomfortable with certain ideas, and we don&#8217;t want someone who will, when they&#8217;re uncomfortable, be able to shoot off a firearm. These students are at an age when they&#8217;re still not fully in control of their impulses, and they&#8217;re away from home for the first time. They&#8217;re very vulnerable.</p> \\n\\n<p>Now what can I do to make the students feel safe? The legislature wrote into the law that if someone tries to prevent someone from a carrying a gun into the class, <a href=\"http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=84R&amp;amp;Bill=SB273\" type=\"external\">they could be fined $1,500 dollars a day</a>. So I can&#8217;t put up a sign. I mean, I&#8217;m allowed to ask students not to bring cell phones into my class. How could that principle not apply to guns?</p> \\n\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ve heard faculty say, &#8216;I&#8217;ll just give everyone A&#8217;s from now on. I&#8217;m not going to risk pissing someone off if they&#8217;re going to be armed.&#8217; Others have said they&#8217;ll only lecture &#8212; they won&#8217;t allow classroom discussion because they don&#8217;t want things to get heated. Basically, we have to look at ruling out anything &#8212; any subject matter &#8212; that might seem provocative. It&#8217;s very strange. Shutting down dissent and free speech is the opposite of what should happen on a college campus. Personally, I don&#8217;t think I would confront a student who was disruptive if he was armed. I&#8217;d rather say, &#8216;Class is dismissed.&#8217;</p> \\n\\n<p>It scares me to think about it. I am accustomed to equipping my students with the skills to negotiate difficult issues. Another class I teach is early British literature &#8212; a lot of writing from 14th and 15th centuries, a lot of which is about religious controversies. Naturally, this brings up religious controversies in the present. I try to endow my students with the ability to talk openly about religious differences; it&#8217;s an important skill for an educated citizenry. In the past, I&#8217;ve had students flip desks and leave the room. Which is fine, because something can be learned from that. But that&#8217;s different than a student pulling a gun &#8212; no one learns anything in that situation. And maybe the student who flips the desk might refrain from doing it if he thinks his classmate is armed. In that sort of environment, I&#8217;m going to be much less willing to go into deep and controversial issues, which is a huge loss, since, later on in life, they&#8217;ll have to grapple with deep and controversial issues. I try to teach them how to have an honest conversation with someone whose views they find repugnant. In order to learn those skills, you have to feel safe. In my women&#8217;s studies classes we talk about feminism, abortion, homosexuality, transgenderism, and birth control. As you know, these aren&#8217;t exactly light topics.</p> \\n\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know of any. And I&#8217;m in touch, via social media, with hundreds and hundreds of professors. Everyone is against it. Even people who are in favor of the right to carry are against the legislation. It&#8217;s not even something the people of Texas want. I can&#8217;t tell you how many parents we&#8217;ve heard from. They say they wouldn&#8217;t have sent their children to UT if they&#8217;d known about the law.</p> \\n\\n<p>I&#8217;ve brought it up in all of my classes, and the students are scared, almost universally. One student said, &#8216;I&#8217;m gay, and I already feel like a target.&#8217; He&#8217;d been sheltered growing up, and thinking about being in class with someone who is armed and might hate LGBT people really scares him and makes him wonder if he made a mistake coming to UT.</p> \\n\\n<p>No, and I don&#8217;t think that would be very helpful, or practical. It&#8217;s not as if there are a ton of academic job openings, which forces us to face the law. But more importantly, I love my job. And unlike the gun lobby and arms industry, who together created this legislation, I have my students&#8217; best interests at heart.</p> \\n\\n<p>[Photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/elmiracollege/3983670183/in/photolist-752mmF-nzfe54-dZM6ar-816wLh-bBbpTB-rKi8G-864GmA-7v4ENF-tqwcm-ni3GbW-6QbNC2-63rXR9-v39Gc-ni3Ge3-5xceGh-8ovzVn-pyzREL-8oyL6f-rKp7K-6PUBHc-9976EK-3mgsdz-8ovA7c-iEv1m-7Pm5dw-4YpwHL-9NuKFS-9N1ei6-73jyy6-aajw5z-9Dz3kM-6QbUyr-EHQ5y-bjtbU4-bjtcaX-bjtd46-9aUaD-anQovi-bjtbZT-bDP2h-57YbBe-5n64zD-gRHf1-furDbu-6c1tx-ah5uS-7FLNZ5-CguLa-4p5WAH-cWDb77\" type=\"external\">Flickr</a>]</p>',\n",

In Greek mythology, Cassandra was the prophetess who no one believed despite her 100 percent record of being right. Telling the truth to Americans or to Europeans is just as expensive as telling the truth to the Greeks in ancient mythology.</p> \\n\\n<p>In America and everywhere in the Western world or the entire world, telling the truth is unpopular. Indeed, in the USA telling the truth has been criminalized. Look, for example, at Bradley Manning, held for two years in prison without bail and without a trial in&amp;#160; violation of the US Constitution, tortured for one year of his illegal confinement in violation of US and international law, and now put on trial by corrupt prosecutors for aiding &#8220;enemies of the US&#8221; by revealing the truth, as required of him by the US military code. US soldiers are required to report war crimes. When Bradley Manning&#8217;s superiors showed themselves to be indifferent to war crimes, Manning reported the crimes via WikiLeaks. What else does a soldier with a sense of duty and a moral conscience do when the chain of command is corrupt?</p> \\n\\n<p>Julian Assange is another example. WikiLeaks has taken up the reporting function that the Western media has abandoned. Remember, the New York Times did publish the Pentagon Papers in 1971, which undermined the lies Washington had told both to the public and to Congress to justify the costly Vietnam War. But today no newspaper or TV channel any longer accepts the responsibility to truthfully inform the public. Julian Assange stepped into the vacuum and was immediately demonized, not merely by Washington but also by left-wing and right-wing media, including Internet. It was a combination of jealousy, ignorance, and doing Washington&#8217;s bidding.</p> \\n\\n<p>Without WikiLeaks and Assange, the world would know essentially nothing. Spin from Washington, the presstitute media, and the puppet state medias would prevail. So the word went out to destroy Julian Assange.</p> \\n\\n<p>It is amazing how many people and Internet sites obeyed Washington&#8217;s command. Assange has been so demonized that even though he has been granted political asylum by Ecuador, the British government, obeying its Washington master, refuses to allow him safe passage out of the London Ecuador Embassy. Is Assange destined to live out his life inside the Ecuador Embassy in London?</p> \\n\\n<p>Will Assange be a replay of Cardinal Jozsef Mindszenty, who on November 4, 1956, sought asylum in the US embassy in Budapest as Soviet tanks poured into Hungary to put down the anti-communist revolution?

              " 6489: '<p>Reporters aren&#8217;t used to being treated with ceremony or solemnity, but as several dozen of us filed into the auditorium at One Police Plaza in downtown Manhattan last week, along with HR and private security professionals, we saw an honor guard waiting in the wings. A contingent&amp;#160;of&amp;#160;New York Police Department officers were kitted out in their dress uniforms, carrying the American, New York State, and September 11th Memorial flags. One held a vintage carbine, the kind used in parades. A sergeant sang the national anthem in dulcet tones as portraits of Alison Parker and Adam&amp;#160;Ward, our <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">fellow journalists slain</a> during what was supposed to be a fluffy, early-morning news broadcast in western Virginia, were projected on a screen above the stage. New York&#8217;s Finest were saluting New York&#8217;s Schlubbiest.&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>We were there to hear from several of the department&#8217;s Counterterrorism Division&#8217;s experts on the state of active shooters, the first training of&amp;#160;its kind specifically for media. While the shooting and media spectacle in Virginia acutely&amp;#160;horrified the fourth estate &#8212; whose members tend to think of themselves as something like Marvel Universe&#8217;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watcher_(comics)\" type=\"external\">Watchers</a>, observers of human insanity and misery but rarely party to it &#8212; it came as little surprise to the NYPD. As the law enforcement experts saw it, some kind of live-broadcast orchestrated active shooter scenario has seemed inevitable since about 2007, around the time social media and uploading homemade video to the Internet&amp;#160;became truly accessible to wide swaths of people.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Since the Virginia Tech case, where the shooter recorded his own video and sent it to TV networks, we have discussed when we&#8217;re going to see a shooting livestreamed, or on live video,&#8221; said John J. Miller, the NYPD&#8217;s Deputy Commissioner for Intelligence and Counterterrorism. &#8220;We&#8217;ve crossed that bridge.&#8221;&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>In practical terms, he made little distinction between the particularly American type of shooter &#8212; disgruntled, adrift loners, attacking centers of leisure or work removed from any larger conflict&amp;#160;&#8212; and groups of ideologically committed terrorists overseas who&#8217;ve rampaged through Tunisian beach resorts, the offices of a French satirical newspaper, and Mumbai&#8217;s grandest hotel. Whatever a shooter&#8217;s motive may be, it doesn&#8217;t make much difference to the civilian scrambling for safety or the police officers rushing to respond.</p> \\n\\n<p>But Miller also identified a trend toward increasing sophistication in active shooter scenarios, both in lethality and (I shudder to use the term in&amp;#160;this context) media strategy.&amp;#160;For many recent attackers, the spectacle &#8212;&amp;#160;its documentation before, during, and after the shots &#8212; was&amp;#160;just as important as the guns and killings themselves. The modern mass shooter uses the terror of killing not just to right some perceived wrong, but to transform themselves. &#8220;There&#8217;s a new identification of self as shooter,&#8221; Miller explained. &#8220;It&#8217;s not unusual to find they got dressed up and photographed themselves in &#8216;warrior mode.&#8217; There&#8217;s also preoccupation with other shooters. In many of these situations, you&#8217;ll see they&#8217;ve studied other cases, number of kills, lots of internet research.&#8221; Vester Flanagan, the Virginia shooter, placed himself squarely in this twisted tradition. He wrote in a manifesto sent to other TV news stations that he&amp;#160;was influenced by Virginia Tech shooter Seung&#8211;Hui Cho. &#8220;That&#8217;s my boy right there. He got NEARLY double the amount that Eric Harris and Dylann Klebold got&#8230;just sayin.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>After Miller finished his portion of the afternoon, two detectives&amp;#160;laid out in detail just how soft journalists are as targets. We were shown a video made at the NYPD&#8217;s Bronx shooting range. A firearm specialist tested a Smith &amp;amp; Wesson .38-caliber revolver, a Glock 9mm semi-automatic pistol, a Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun, and an AK-47 style rifle on pieces of office furniture. The desks, cubicle partitions, and filing cabinets that surround the typical media worker provide little to no cover from an armed assailant. Only the metal filing cabinet provided any measure of cover, though the AK-47 made short work of that, its steel-tipped rounds easily passing through the multiple metal layers that would have (maybe) stopped a hollow-point bullet or buckshot pellet. The assembled journalists watched in&amp;#160;silence. As to whether&amp;#160;we played it close to the chest out of shock or stoic sangfroid? No comment.</p> \\n\\n<p>A pamphlet laid out our options should we find ourselves in an active shooter scenario: ABC, or Avoid, Barricade, Confront. It was easy enough to imagine high-tailing it out of a building or huddling behind chairs blocking doors, but that &#8220;Confront&#8221; section gave little comfort. &#8220;There is no single procedure that can be recommended in this situation,&#8221; it began. Given the high level of coordination and training police needed to respond to active shooters, above and beyond the standard Academy curriculum, it was hard to imagine myself or most of my fellow hacks rising to the challenge.</p> \\n\\n<p>One more bullet point under the &#8220;Confront&#8221; heading stood out: &#8220;Attempt to quickly overpower the individual with force in the most violent manner possible.&#8221; We were asked what office supplies could make do as weapons. The answers volunteered did not inspire confidence: a smartphone? A cup of coffee?&amp;#160;After an awkward silence, one metro reporter sitting in first row looked at his pen. A&amp;#160;pen? &#8220;Pens, yes!&#8221; A&amp;#160;detective exclaimed, agreeing that writing implements likely offer the most stopping power of any element in the reporter&#8217;s arsenal.</p> \\n\\n<p>The little <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/More-Guns-Less-Crime-Understanding/dp/0226493636\" type=\"external\">John Lott</a> sitting on my shoulder wondered about other options.&amp;#160;Inevitably after each high-profile shooting, someone quickly wonders if the victims could have saved themselves and prevented more bloodshed if only they&#8217;d been armed. But <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">research</a> has cast serious doubt on firearms&#8217; comparative effectiveness for self-defense. As the discussion wore on, it became clear that the police didn&#8217;t truly expect us&amp;#160;reporters to marshal tactical expertise or deadly force in the face of a killer.&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>I asked if the NYPD considered the Good Guy With a Gun scenario when developing their active shooter protocols. Deputy Commissioner Miller replied with&amp;#160;a flat no &#8212; it didn&#8217;t enter into their thinking, at least not when considering the civilians&amp;#160;in the department&#8217;s jurisdiction. &#8220;There are a minimal number of carry permits, business permits, or even legal guns in New York,&#8221; he said. He allowed that things might be different for the police who dealt with the assault on the Garland, Texas, show of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad: &#8220;It&#8217;s not like Texas where two terrorists can show up to an art show with two AK-47s and multiple magazines and still be outgunned. I love that about Texas.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>It was hard not to take away from the presentation that dumb&amp;#160;luck&amp;#160;still provided the best chance of surviving a mass shooting. That included the dumb luck that we happened to be employed in New York City. One reporter asked Miller how the department had dealt with the most recent local incident to resemble an active shooter scenario: The late August killing in which a one-time whistleblower fatally shot&amp;#160;a security guard at the federal building in SoHo before turning the gun on himself. Miller said that&amp;#160;was more of a murder-suicide, though he&amp;#160;noted that the shooter had brought multiple guns &#8212; it was anyone&#8217;s guess why he didn&#8217;t go further and kill more.</p> \\n\\n<p>Miller wasn&#8217;t interested in speculating. He just said&amp;#160;that, for whatever reason, in the country&#8217;s largest metropolis, where &#8220;there are lots of targets&#8221; to entice a mass shooter, it &#8220;almost never&#8221; happens here.</p> \\n\\n<p>[Photo: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/european_parliament/6877940682/in/photolist-btMf9b-ahYnK2-ahYnXH-9rhuc4-5Er3o1-pbB4Yd-9ciiDw-oW9wQS-9qPsFD-8ZCFZX-949MkY-8MneV3-oWayq3-9eXUZU-98etfg-9qPsLa-oW3LQq-9qSszG-vCF4iJ-5LDsRZ-9saKeN-9qSsv5-9qPsMF-9s7Ls4-9qSsoY-bxY1vq-5Txp2V-6jERwK-ahYnR8-ai2biq-ahYnx6-7a4Dt7-9k9BCU-hj22zj-9HcWYp-eH2V1D-6DCeTy-g7FDcr-9iwHh8-atyH9n-y38KL1-tuc9JN-atBnf5-5En59p-9PDB2p-8Zh5rm-8Zh5Bb-9i7Vrw-k33z9v-5TBMwE\" type=\"external\">Flickr</a>]</p>',\n",

It&#8217;s fun to celebrate with immigrant groups that make America great and share the common bond of citizenship. As with most enjoyable holidays, people have no idea what they are actually celebrating. On St. Patrick&#8217;s Day, people across the country celebrate Irish pride but are actually celebrating the death of a British man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery.</p> \\n\\n<p>Saint Patrick is known for converting Irish pagans to Christianity, and he became a Catholic saint for his effort. When Patrick was sixteen, Irish raiders kidnapped and sold him into slavery until he escaped and fled to an English monastery six years later. Patrick&#8217;s Catholic forgiveness game must have been on point because he returned to Ireland in the early fifth century and changed the country&#8217;s religious landscape.</p> \\n\\n<p>On March 17th we celebrate everything Irish, and some confuse Irish pride with privilege, but history tells a different tale of Irish immigrants. The British fanned the flames of the potato famine and started the Irish Diaspora to America. In the book, The Irish in America, Michael Coffey writes, &#8220;The bureaucrats and politicians in London, charged as they were with seeing to it that the Irish people did not become dependent on government assistance, took a decidedly unemotional view of the suffering.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>One man&#8217;s potato famine would ultimately be America&#8217;s gain. But immigration process was not easy. The newly arrived Irish were not initially welcome in America and quickly fell into negative stereotypes. They were depicted as happy drunks who were lazy, stupid and prone to violence. From the 1840s to the early 1900s, some Irish Americans would be met with signs telling them, &#8220; <a href=\"http://www.irishcentral.com/roots/history/high-school-student-disproves-professors-theory-that-no-irish-need-apply-signs-never-existed\" type=\"external\">No Irish Need Apply</a>..</p> \\n\\n<p>The Irish didn&#8217;t have it easy throughout history; nonetheless, they\\'ve persevered and thrived, and their descendants should be proud of that heritage.

For the believers who turned to him, Elyashiv\\'s rulings carried the weight of someone privy to God\\'s will.</p> \\n\\n<p>Elyashiv was primarily concerned with \"safeguarding haredi Orthodoxy\\'s parochialism.\" He successfully fought to keep secular subjects out of haredi schools, opposed \"occupational training for haredi men\" and disapproved of haredi women working outside the home. His political arm in the Knesset was the Degel HaTorah party, which currently has two mandates and followed his political direction.</p> \\n\\n<p>Throughout his life, Elyashiv spent most of his time studying Talmud; Professor Brown of Hebrew University attributes \"Elyashiv\\'s extreme conservatism to his limited social contact with the outside world.\" The effects of his conservatism were felt beyond his own Litvak community:</p> \\n\\n<p>In large part due to Elyashiv\\'s opposition, the Israeli Chief Rabbinate has not instituted the use of prenuptial agreements that could help reduce the agunah problem - women who are \"chained\" to husbands who refuse to grant them a religious writ of divorce, or \"get\" - by imposing hefty monthly fines on uncooperative husbands.</p> \\n\\n<p>Elyashiv\\'s impact was vast and he has left an immense power vacuum at a time when the haredi community is in desperate need of leadership. Though haredim like to portray the choosing of a leader as unanimous communal elevation of the most worthy man, the process is in fact very political. The struggle for succession among the haredi elite began a few weeks ago with fights over control of Yated Ne\\'eman, the Litvak haredi newspaper. Given the current debates in Israel over women\\'s rights and haredi exemption from military service, we hope Elyashiv\\'s successor will match him in Torah knowledge but surpass him in social engagement.</p>',\n",

I believe that at this time I can be more effective in a decisive role to help elect other true public servants to office - from the nation\\'s governors to Congressional seats and the Presidency. We need to continue to actively and aggressively help those who will stop the \"fundamental transformation\" of our nation and instead seek the restoration of our greatness, our goodness and our constitutional republic based on the rule of law.From the bottom of my heart I thank those who have supported me and defended my record throughout the years, and encouraged me to run for President. Know that by working together we can bring this country back - and as I\\'ve always said, one doesn\\'t need a title to help do it.I will continue driving the discussion for freedom and free markets, including in the race for President where our candidates must embrace immediate action toward energy independence through domestic resource developments of conventional energy sources, along with renewables. We must reduce tax burdens and onerous regulations that kill American industry, and our candidates must always push to minimize government to strengthen the economy and allow the private sector to create jobs.Those will be our priorities so Americans can be confident that a smaller, smarter government that is truly of the people, by the people, and for the people can better serve this most exceptional nation.In the coming weeks I will help coordinate strategies to assist in replacing the President, re-taking the Senate, and maintaining the House.Thank you again for all your support. Let\\'s unite to restore this country!God bless America.- Sarah Palin</p>',\n",
              " 6587: '<p>Like any print publication looking to make a buck, the National Rifle Association&#8217;s American Rifleman magazine mixes some marketing messages&amp;#160;into its email newsletter. Amid the previews of Wayne LaPierre&#8217;s latest missives, enthusiasm for Kimber revolvers, and anecdotes about defensive gun use, the magazine&#8217;s March 9 blast included a promotion seemingly tied to the lead poisoning crisis in Flint, Michigan. Looking identical to the previews of NRA editorial content it ran alongside &#8212; save for an &#8220;advertisement&#8221; label in small white font overlaying the photo &#8212; the text raised&amp;#160;questions about &#8220;Toxic Tap Water.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The item spells out for its readers the lesson of the water contamination in Flint: &#8220;Relying on the government to have your interest at heart is a huge mistake.&#8221; Instead, the ad suggests buying the Alexapure, &#8220;a revolutionary tabletop water filtration system&#8221; that looks like an oversized &#8217;70s-era coffee percolator and is&amp;#160;sold by a company called Water4Patriots. The item links to a video for Alexapure narrated by a gravelly-voiced Southerner named Frank Bates, a company spokesman. The video highlights the need for home water purification products with a montage of past water disasters like the industrial contamination of West Virginia and Colorado rivers, algae blooms in the Great Lakes, and methane gas loosed by fracking. It also warns about water contaminated by &#8220;brain-eating amoebas.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>4Patriots&#8217;s products may&amp;#160;be familiar to anyone who follows conservative media outlets like Newsmax and the National Review, as the company has often advertised in their email blasts as well. The spots cater to the doomsday prepper set. Past American Rifleman newsletters featured Food4Patriots, dehydrated &#8220;survival food&#8221; rations touted as the &#8220;#1 Item You Should Be Hoarding in 2016&#8221; (before FEMA corners the supply). There&#8217;s also Power4Patriots, which promotes a homebrewed solar power system, and SurvivalSeed4Patriots, for those hoping to homestead after civilization collapses.</p> \\n\\n<p>In 2014, <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2014/01/30/3134851/conservatives-food4patriots/\" type=\"external\">ThinkProgress</a> looked into the company behind all those products after seeing ads for Food4Patriots. The article found no evidence that Bates actually exists, and tied the company to a Nashville-area man named Allen Baler. Baler appears to be engaged in what&#8217;s known as &#8220;affiliate marketing,&#8221; creating his own distinct pitch for products actually sold by a larger company known as ClickBank. In 2011, he started his venture by placing ads on the conservative website Newsmax&#8217;s email lists, which have 1.8 million subscribers.</p> \\n\\n<p>Speaking with scientists and experts on advertising law, ThinkProgress found the 4Patriots products were survivalist snake oil. A physicist said that the claims about the Power4Patriots solar panels made no sense &#8212;&amp;#160;the kind of cost reductions promised could only be achieved with very advanced solar systems that use semiconductors, and can&#8217;t be made by DIY preppers. Moreover, the company&#8217;s advertisements came close to violating Federal Trade Commission rules about truth in advertising, since it relied on personal testimonials from the apparently fictional Frank Bates. The National Review stopped running its 4Patriot ads just before Think Progress&#8217;s story was published.</p> \\n\\n<p>But today, the NRA still regularly distributes the company&#8217;s ads, which dovetail closely with the gun organization&#8217;s ideology. The spots use recent events in Flint (and in Newark and other struggling, smaller cities) to push a product they claim will compensate for the federal government&#8217;s inadequacy, fecklessness, corruption, or possible malicious intent. This pitch echos NRA rhetoric on the essential value of a gun. &#8220;After Hurricane Sandy,&#8221; Wayne LaPierre <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2013/02/13/stand-and-fight/\" type=\"external\">wrote in the Daily Caller in February 2013</a>, &#8220;we saw the hellish world that gun prohibitionists see as their utopia.&#8221; Writing to rally the faithful after President Obama&#8217;s second inauguration, LaPierre explained that Americans face natural and social disaster, and a gun is the best protection: &#8220;Hurricanes. Tornadoes. Riots. Terrorists. Gangs. Lone criminals. These are perils we are sure to face &#8212; not just maybe &#8230; Gun owners are not buying firearms because they anticipate a confrontation with the government. Rather, we anticipate confrontations where the government isn&#8217;t there &#8212; or simply doesn&#8217;t show up in time.&#8221; (Neither the NRA nor 4Patriots responded to requests for comment.)</p> \\n\\n<p>On <a href=\"http://www.highya.com/food-4-patriots-reviews\" type=\"external\">highya.com,</a> a consumer reports website, a survivalist who had come across the 4Patriots links in American Rifleman gave the products a lousy review. He noted that&amp;#160;the operator who handled his purchase was constantly trying to add things to his order. When he got the dehydrated food packages, he found them to be of poor quality. He said he would reserve them only &#8220;for last ditch use or bartering should there be a need.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>[Photo: Shutterstock]</p>',\n",

              " 6599: '<p>In the midst of continuous and intense media coverage and political crisis management our response to the Toulouse killings must be put in proper perspective. As in any situation of war or violence, compassion for the victims, adults and children alike, is our first obligation. Grief and despair has touched French families, be they Jewish, Catholic, Muslim or without religion. Far from the floodlights and the excited commentary, far from hypotheses and from possible political exploitation, our hearts and minds go out to them in an intimate encounter that alone can express our condolences and our feelings of brotherhood. The loss of a child, a brother, a father, a sister, a friend in such circumstances is all but unbearable. But what is tragedy in Toulouse is no less so at the graves of all innocent victims whether in the West, in Africa or the Middle East. They remind us of our shared humanity, of the horrors men commit, of the dignity of resistance, and of the fragility of all our achievements. To the victims, to all victims, go our thoughts and our affection, and our respectful silence.</p> \\n\\n<p>Twenty-three year-old Mohamed Merah was a familiar face in and beyond his neighborhood. People describe him as quiet, easy-going, nothing at all like an &#8220;extremist Salafi jihadi&#8221; ready to kill for a religious or political cause. His lawyer, who had previously defended him in offenses ranging from petty theft to armed robbery, had never detected even a hint of religious leanings, let alone of the Salafi stripe. He had just been tried and sentenced for theft and driving without a permit. Two weeks before the shooting, witnesses said he spent an evening carousing in a nightclub. In 2010 and 2011 he traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan, and earlier attempted to join the French army, which considering his criminal record and what is known about his brief life, proved unsuccessful. Mohamed Merah stands before us like an overgrown adolescent, unemployed, at loose ends, soft-hearted but at the same time disturbed and incoherent, as illustrated by his long hours of conversation with the police before the final assault on apartment. An unbalanced, provocative, conscious, non-suicidal killer who wanted, as he put it, to &#8220;bring France to its knees.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Religion was not Mohamed Merah&#8217;s problem; nor was politics. A French citizen frustrated at being unable to find his place, to give his life dignity and meaning in his own country, he would find two political causes through which he could articulate his distress: Afghanistan and Palestine. He attacked symbols: the army, and killed Jews, Christians and Muslims without distinction. His <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\" />political thought was that of a young man adrift, imbued neither with the values of Islam, nor driven by racism and anti-Semitism. Young, disoriented, he chose targets whose significance seem to have been chosen based on little more than their visibility. A pathetic young man, guilty and condemnable beyond the shadow of a doubt, even though he himself was the victim of a social order that had already doomed him, and millions of others like him, to a marginal existence, to non-recognition of his status as a citizen equal in rights and opportunities.</p> \\n\\n<p>Mohamed&#8212;how typical the name is!&#8212;was a French citizen of immigrant background before dying as a terrorist of immigrant origin. Early on his destiny became confused with perceptions of that origin. In one last act of provocation, he had come full circle and vanished into the image to become the definitive &#8220;other.&#8221; For the French of France, there can no longer anything French about Mohamed the Muslim Arab. That cannot, of course, excuse his actions. But let us at least hope that France can learn the lesson that Mohamed Merah had neither the intention nor the means to teach: he was French, as were all his victims (in the name of what strange logic are they differentiated and categorized by religion?), but he felt himself constantly reduced to his origin by his skin color, his religion and his name. The overwhelming majority of the Mohameds, the Fatimas or the Ahmeds of the housing projects and the banlieues are French; what they seek is equality, dignity, security, a decent job and a place to live. They are culturally and religiously integrated; their problems are overwhelmingly socio-economic. The story of Mohamed Merah today holds up to France a mirror in which it sees its face, that of a young man who ended up a Jihadi without conviction, after having been deprived of his dignity as a citizen. Once more, this excuses nothing. But therein lies a crucial lesson for us all.</p> \\n\\n<p>A two-day suspension of the presidential election campaign was announced. Nothing could have been more illusory. The suspension itself was political. With the election one month away, analysts and journalists are speculating about who could turn the affair to maximum political advantage. Nicolas Sarkozy, posing as president of all the French, holds a winning hand. The Toulouse killings can be predicted to shift the focus of the president election even further to the right. There will be much talk of insecurity and violent Islamism, and of Afghanistan, Israel and Palestine on the international level. Precisely where President Sarkozy is at ease. In his role as crisis manager he can encroach on the territory of the Front National, and display to excess his international stature, where his record is less objectionable. The game is far from over, and the weeks to come may well hold surprises. The opposition candidates are in a holding pattern, as though paralyzed at the thought of a slip-up, while Nicolas Sarkozy is now in a position of symbolic strength, a position carries substantial weight, even though the final outcome is still in doubt.</p> \\n\\n<p>All the maneuvering and the grand gestures have created a feeling of extraordinary malaise. The victims, the dead, their families, and the underlying social and political questions have become secondary. Now is the time for cold calculation, for strategy. Politicians wield the power of symbols just as certainly as Mohamed Merah in his impotence struck at those symbols. Now, these same themes have forced their way into the election campaign, carried along by a flood tide of emotion. Much will be said of integration, of Islamism, of Islam, of anti-Semitism, of security, of immigration, or the lost banlieues, of international relations&#8212;but it will not be the speech of democrats in tune with the people&#8217;s aspirations but populists exploiting events and mocking those aspirations. The President plays at being president, while his opponents seek only to prove that they are worthy pretenders. Where we might have hoped for a true debate on political issues, we must now make do with trapeze artists, jugglers, and illusionists, and with clever and cynical attempts to exploit a tragedy.</p> \\n\\n<p>In Toulouse, France now beholds its own mirror image. The crisis has revealed that the candidates long ago stopped engaging in politics, not simply for two days in tribute to the victims of a terrorist act, but for years. For years, in fact, real social and economic problems have been pushed aside; a substantial number of French citizens are treated as second-class citizens. Mohamed Merah was French.

He didn&#8217;t show up when he should have showed up.</p> \\n\\n<p>President Bush defended his service in another nationally television interview, on NBC&#8217;s&amp;#160;&#8220;Meet the Press&#8221; Feb. 8:</p> \\n\\n<p>Tim Russert: The Boston Globe and The Associated Press have gone through some of the records and said there&#8217;s no evidence that you reported to duty in Alabama during the summer and fall of 1972.</p> \\n\\n<p>Bush:&amp;#160;Yeah, they&#8217;re &#8212; they&#8217;re just wrong.&amp;#160; There may be no evidence, but I did report; otherwise, I wouldn&#8217;t have been honorably discharged.&amp;#160; In other words, you don&#8217;t just say &#8220;I did something&#8221; without there being verification.&amp;#160; Military doesn&#8217;t work that way.&amp;#160; I got an honorable discharge, and I did show up in Alabama.</p> \\n\\n<p>Russert: You did &#8212; were allowed to leave eight months before your term expired.&amp;#160; Was there a reason?</p> \\n\\n<p>Bush:&amp;#160;Right. Well, I was going to Harvard Business School and worked it out with the military.</p> \\n\\n<p>Immediately after Bush&#8217;s appearance John Kerry said Bush&#8217;s honorable discharge does not settle the question of whether he skipped Air National Guard drills when he was supposed to. &#8220;Just because you get an honorable discharge does not in fact answer that question,&#8221; Kerry told reporters.</p> \\n\\n<p>In the NBC Interview Bush pledged to release any records that would clear up the matter:</p> \\n\\n<p>Russert:&amp;#160;But you would allow pay stubs, tax records, anything to show that you were serving during that period?</p> \\n\\n<p>Bush:&amp;#160;Yeah.&amp;#160; If we still have them, but I &#8212; you know, the records are kept in Colorado, as I understand, and they scoured the records.</p> \\n\\n<p>And I&#8217;m just telling you, I did my duty. . .</p> \\n\\n<p>Russert:&amp;#160;But you authorize the release of everything to settle this?</p> \\n\\n<p>Bush:&amp;#160;Yes, absolutely.</p> \\n\\n<p>On February 10 Boston Globe reporter Walter V. Robinson &#8212; who first reported four years ago that there was a year-long gap in Bush&#8217;s record of National Guard service &#8212; reported&amp;#160;he had obtained&amp;#160;two new documents that partially filled in that gap: &#8220;The personnel records. . . constitute the first evidence that Bush appeared for any duty during the first 11 months of that 12-month period. Bush is recorded as having served the minimum number of days expected of Guard members in that 12 months of service time.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Later that same day the the White House released copies of those documents and others, including payroll records showing Bush had been paid for several drills during the period and was credited with meeting military point requirements for the 12-month period in question.</p> \\n\\n<p>The White House said it had obtained all the documents from the Air Force Air Reserve Personnel Center in Denver, Colorado, and had not known some of them existed until Bush aides inquired after the President promised in his NBC interview to release whatever is available.</p> \\n\\n<p>The records show that National Guard officials credited&amp;#160;Bush with enough points to meet minimum requirements for the 12-month period ending&amp;#160;May 26, 1973, the period of the original alleged &#8220;gap&#8221; in his records. An Air Force &#8220;Reserve Personnel&amp;#160; <a href=\"imagefiles/Document%202%20-%20USAF%20Reserve%20Personnel%20Record%20Card.gif\" type=\"external\">Record Card</a>&#8221; shows Bush received a total of 9 points for active duty training, 31 points for inactive duty training, and 15 points awarded for his membership in the reserves. The points total 56, exceeding&amp;#160;the 50-point requirement for satisfactory service during the period, though barely.</p> \\n\\n<p>Other documents include one-page Air Force Reserve summaries of points earned in the 12-month period ending in May 1973, and the subsequent period running through Bush&#8217;s last credited service in July 1973. (See &#8220;supporting documents&#8221;).</p> \\n\\n<p>Also released were copies of microfilm payroll records summarizing the days for which Bush was paid in 1972 and 1973. Though blurry and hard to read, they reflect payments for 82 days of services in 1972 and 1973.</p> \\n\\n<p>Also released was a memo the White House requested from Retired Lieutenant Colonel Albert. C. Lloyd Jr., a former personnel director for the Texas Air Guard during the time of Bush&#8217;s service. Lloyd said&amp;#160;of&amp;#160;the payroll and personnel records, &#8220;This clearly shows that 1LT George W. Bush has satisfactory years for both 72-73 and 73-74 which proves that he completed his military obligation in a satisfactory manner.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Lloyd was later interviewed by the Boston Globe , which questioned whether Bush had met &#8220;minimum training&#8221; requirements in addition to &#8220;minimum retirement&#8221; credits. The newspaper said Guardsman are required to serve 15 days of active duty to meet training requirements. The Globe quoted Lloyd as saying of Bush: &#8221; Should he have done more? Yes, he should have. Did he have to? No.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The records also show that Bush was credited with very little service during the period when he was in Alabama working on the unsuccessful 1972 Senate campaign of Republican Winton Blunt. Bush was paid and also got retirement credit for 30 days in the first four months of 1972, through April 16. But then begins a six-month gap.</p> \\n\\n<p>During those six months Bush got permission from his National Guard superiors to attend non-flying drills in Montgomery. Also during that time he was officially grounded after&amp;#160;he failed&amp;#160;to take an annual physical examination required to maintain flying status. But the records show Bush received no pay or credits between April 16 and late October.</p> \\n\\n<p>The Boston Globe reported Feb. 12&amp;#160;that Bush&#8217;s suspension from flight duty&amp;#160;while he was in Alabama&amp;#160;&#8220;should have prompted an investigation by his commander&#8221; in Houston under Air Force regulations in effect at the time. The Globe also said &#8220;It is unclear whether Bush&#8217;s commander, Lieutenant Colonel Jerry B. Killian, ordered any inquiry, as required.&#8221; Killian is deceased.</p> \\n\\n<p>The records show Bush was paid and credited for drills on October 28 and 29, just days before the 1972 election. The records don&#8217;t show where the service was performed, but this would have been toward the end of&amp;#160;his time in Alabama. Bush was&amp;#160;also paid and credited for four days November 11-14, 1972, around the&amp;#160;time his aides say Bush was in Alabama briefly following the election.</p> \\n\\n<p>That tends to support&amp;#160;Bush&#8217;s statement that he did perform duty in Alabama, though it falls short of conclusive proof.</p> \\n\\n<p>The commander to whom Bush was supposed to report, retired Brigadier General William Turnipseed, said four years ago&amp;#160;that he had no&amp;#160;recollection of Bush appearing at his unit. But&amp;#160;Turnipseed&amp;#160;recently&amp;#160;backed off&amp;#160;that statement a bit, according to the&amp;#160;a Washington Post story on February 4. Turnipseed said &#8220;he could not recall if he had been on base much at that time,&#8221; the Post reported.</p> \\n\\n<p>And after records were released, The Washington Times&amp;#160;reported that a woman who had dated Bush during the summer of 1972,&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Emily Marks Curtis, says&amp;#160;she &#8220;distinctly remembers&#8221; Bush returning to Montgomery after the election to fulfill his Air National Guard commitment.&amp;#160;&#8220;I can say categorically he was there, and that&#8217;s why he came back,&#8221;&amp;#160;the Times quoted her as saying. She added that Bush rented an apartment for a two-week stay and that she met him for dinner several times. While she did not claim to have witnessed him doing Guard duty, according to the Times she said, &#8220;He told me that was why he was in Montgomery. There is no other reason why he would come back to Montgomery.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>And in fact, Bush was at Dannelly Air National Guard base in Montgomery as late as Jan. 6, 1973, according to a document released by the White House Feb. 11. The document is a record of a dental examination of Bush on that date.&amp;#160;The payroll records released two days earlier show Bush received pay and credit for service for Jan. 6 and for five other days closely clustered between Jan. 4 and Jan. 10.</p> \\n\\n<p>On Feb. 13, the White House released hundreds of additional pages from Bush&#8217;s military records. Nothing in those files, however, provided any further documentation of Bush&#8217;s presence at Dannelly Air National Guard Base in Alabama beyond the single dental examination record.</p> \\n\\n<p>An additional witness came forward to say that he had seen Bush at the base. John W. &#8220;Bill&#8221; Calhoun was quoted by the Washington Post and others as saying he saw Bush sign in at the base eight to 10 times for about eight hours each from May to October 1972. However, as previously noted, there is record of Bush being paid for only two days of Guard service during that period, Oct. 28 and 29 1972. A White House spokesman could not offer an explanation for the discrepancy.</p> \\n\\n<p>The newly released records show only sporadic service by Bush during the months immediately following the 1972 election. They show pay and credits for six days in January 1973 and two in April.</p> \\n\\n<p>It was the following month that his two superior officers at Ellington Air Force Base wrote that they could not complete Bush&#8217;s annual evaluation covering the 12 months ending April 30, 1973 because &#8220;Lt. Bush has not been observed at this unit during the period of this report.&#8221; How could Bush be paid and credited for drills and still not be &#8220;observed&#8221; by his superiors? Both of&amp;#160;them are now dead and can&#8217;t answer that.&amp;#160;White House Communications Director Dan Bartlett says Bush was doing &#8220;odd jobs&#8221; for the Guard at the time in a non-flying capacity and his superiors might not have been aware of that.</p> \\n\\n<p>Also, the newly released dental record now suggests that Bush was still performing duty in Alabama, not Houston, as late as January. It is not clear where his two days of service in April, 1973 were performed, but if they were in Houston they would be the only two days of service there in the period covered by the report&amp;#160;saying he was &#8220;not observed.&#8221;&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>The records do show a flurry of activity by Bush in May, June and July, 1973, as&amp;#160;Bush was applying for an early release from the Guard in order to attend the Harvard Business School. In those three months Bush got credit for 38 days of service, more than he got for all of 1972. His last recorded day was July 30, 1973. He was released from service with an honorable discharge eight months before the end of the six-year term of service for which he had originally signed up.</p> \\n\\n<p>Release of the payroll and personnel summaries didn&#8217;t quiet all the President&#8217;s critics. DNC chairman McAuliffe said, &#8221;The handful of documents released today by the White House creates more questions than answers.&#8221; But Kerry&amp;#160;himself said he had no comment.&amp;#160; &#8220;It&#8217;s not an issue that I chose to create,&#8221; he told reporters at Dulles airport in Washington. &#8220;It&#8217;s not my record that&#8217;s at issue, and I don&#8217;t have any questions about it.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>There were these other developments:</p> \\n\\n<p>The Boston Globe reported Feb. 12&amp;#160;that Bush&#8217;s suspension from flight duty&amp;#160;while he was in Alabama&amp;#160;&#8220;should have prompted an investigation by his commander&#8221; in Houston under Air Force regulations in effect at the time. The Globe also said &#8220;It is unclear whether Bush&#8217;s commander, Lieutenant Colonel Jerry B. Killian, ordered any inquiry, as required.&#8221; Killian is deceased.</p> \\n\\n<p>The Dallas Morning News reported Feb. 12 an allegation that Bush documents were discarded in 1997. The News said a retired Guard Lieutenant Colonel, Bill Burkett,&amp;#160;said that in 1997 he overheard then-Gov. Bush&#8217;s chief of staff, Joe Allbaugh, tell the chief of the National Guard to get the Bush file and make certain &#8220;there&#8217;s not anything there that will embarrass the governor.&#8221;&amp;#160; The newspaper quoted Burkett as saying that a few days later he saw Mr. Bush&#8217;s file and documents from it discarded in a trash can, and that he recognized the documents as retirement point summaries and pay forms.</p> \\n\\n<p>The trash-can allegation is puzzling because the type of documents alleged to be discarded are the same type of documents that the White House produced Feb. 10 after receiving copies from and Air Force Reserve storage facility in Denver, and which the White House now cites as proof of Bush&#8217;s service.</p> \\n\\n<p>The New York Times also quoted Burkett Feb. 12 as saying he overheard Bush aides requesting a review of Bush&#8217;s personnel files in 1997, but the Times did not report any allegation from Burkett that documents had been discarded. Both the Times and Dallas Morning News reported denials from various Guard officials and Bush aides&amp;#160;that any documents had been destroyed.</p> \\n\\n<p>On Feb. 13, moreover, the Boston Globe reported that Burkett&#8217;s account is contradicted by a key witness, a friend of Burkett who was present at the time and place Burkett claims to have seen documents discarded.</p> \\n\\n<p>The Globe reported:</p> \\n\\n<p>But a key witness to some of the events described by Burkett has told the Globe that the central elements of his story are false.</p> \\n\\n<p>George O. Conn, a former chief warrant officer with the Guard and a friend of Burkett&#8217;s, is the person whom Burkett says led him to the room where the Bush records were being vetted. But Conn says he never saw anyone combing through the Bush file or discarding records.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;I have no recall of that,&#8221; Conn said. &#8220;I have no recall of that whatsoever.

              " 6675: \"<p>When I read that Gene Nichol, president of the College of William and Mary, had ordered removed from the chapel the bronze cross that had stood there for a century or so, my first response was anger. Nichol decided that the cross was offensive to non-Christian students and for that reason should be kept in the sacristy, a tiny room behind the back wall of the chapel. Whereas in previous years, the cross could be removed for any event by request, now a request has to be made for the cross to be displayed.</p> \\n\\n<p>As I thought about the anger I felt, I realized that my resentment had been building over time. I resented that values Christians hold seem to have been replaced by the value society places on diversity and the apparently nationally-held right for secular peoples to be unoffended by what religious people value.</p> \\n\\n<p>I was angry that when TV network programmers and Hollywood producers feature a steady barrage of immorality and profanity as normative, the offense I express is viewed as an indication of my narrow-mindedness and my need for diversity training.</p> \\n\\n<p>I was angry that so much of our history seems to be subject to the whims of revisionists who wish to expunge any reference to Christ and Christianity from our past. Presumably a cross had been a fixture in the chapel since it was constructed more than three centuries ago. The hundred-year-old cross in question had not only been a symbol of faith, but had also provided mute testimony declaring something of the college's and our nation's history. What other historical reverences to religion will give offense to someone? Will the fact that the first president of the college was also a clergyman be revised in history books so as not to give offense? For that matter, why not tear down the chapel altogether since its very presence will surely offend the atheist students?</p> \\n\\n<p>But I was not only angry, I was fearful. Although there is no logical correlation between the election of the first Muslim to the U.S. Congress (by the same voters who chose a mouthy professional wrestler to be their governor) and Nichol's edict to remove the cross, at the visceral level it seemed that Christianity is being handicapped and unappreciated by the very government made great by its values. Conversely, it seemed that Islam and other non-Christian systems are provided every advantage.</p> \\n\\n<p>As I say, all this was taking place at the &#8220;feeling&#8221; level.</p> \\n\\n<p>At the &#8220;thinking&#8221; level, I was proceeding more slowly. Fact: the College of William and Mary is a state-supported university. Fact: the constitution guarantees that &#8220;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.&#8221; Fact: Jesus proclaimed, &#8220;Whatsoever you would that men should do to you, do ye even so unto them.&#8221; When we are most Christ-like, Christians wish to respect the beliefs of others and not cause them to feel as if they are somehow second-class. Fact: Jesus said, &#8220;My kingdom is not of this world.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>But also at the &#8220;thinking&#8221; level I wondered if diversity should also include recognizing that different forces and values have influenced our development as a nation? The college's Office of Multicultural Student Affairs' mission statement asserts it will strive to &#8220;create an awareness of and appreciation for racial and cultural diversity.&#8221; The office further states that its mission is &#8220;to educate the entire campus community on issues of diversity and multiculturalism.&#8221; This being the case, shouldn't Nichols have helped non-Christian students understand the history of the college and the Christian influences that helped shape it even before there was a U.S. to have a constitution?</p> \\n\\n<p>At the spiritual level, it was, ironically, my 3-year-old granddaughter, Brooke, who helped me process my thoughts. We were looking at a small wooden nativity scene I had purchased at the Baptist Book Store in Amman, Jordan. At some point in my travel, the glue holding the &#8220;Baby Jesus&#8221; figure had broken, allowing the figure to slide from side to side and even out of the stable. When &#8220;Jesus&#8221; fell out when she turned the nativity over, Brooke noted, &#8220;Hey, Baby Jesus won't stay where he belongs.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>President Nichol can remove the cross from the chapel if he has the authority to do so. He can put it in a back room if he wishes. But he needs to understand that Jesus won't stay where he belongs. Jesus has a habit of breaking the restraints and not staying where we put him. Nichols is fighting a losing battle in trying to keep Jesus from being offensive to some.</p> \\n\\n<p>I do not know of Nichol's specific religious beliefs nor whether he is a spiritual person at all.

              " 6691: '<p>WASHINGTON (AP) - More than 1 million Americans are experiencing a harrowing jolt in 2014 as extended federal unemployment benefits came to a sudden halt on Dec. 28, with potentially significant implications for the recovering U.S. economy. A tense political battle likely looms when Congress reconvenes in this midterm election year.</p> \\n\\n<p>Nudging Congress along, a vacationing President Barack Obama called two senators proposing an extension to offer his support. From Hawaii, Obama pledged on Dec. 27 to push Congress to move quickly this year to address the \"urgent economic priority,\" the White House said.</p> \\n\\n<p>For families dependent on cash assistance, the end of the federal government\\'s \"emergency unemployment compensation\" will mean some difficult belt-tightening as enrollees lose their average monthly stipend of $1,166.</p> \\n\\n<p>Jobless rates could drop, but analysts say the economy may suffer with less money for consumers to spend on everything from clothes to cars. Having let the \"emergency\" program expire as part of a budget deal, it\\'s unclear if Congress has the appetite to start it anew.</p> \\n\\n<p>An estimated 1.3 million people were cut off when the federally funded unemployment payments ended in late December.</p> \\n\\n<p>Some 214,000 Californians lost their payments, a figure expected to rise to more than a half-million by June, the Labor Department said. In the last 12 months, Californians received $4.5 billion in federal jobless benefits, much if plowed back into the local economy.</p> \\n\\n<p>More than 127,000 New Yorkers also were cut off on Dec. 28. In New Jersey, 11th among states in population, 90,000 people have lost out.</p> \\n\\n<p>Started under President George W. Bush, the benefits were designed as a cushion for the millions of U.S. citizens who lost their jobs in a recession and failed to find new ones while receiving state jobless benefits, which in most states expire after six months. Another 1.9 million people across the country are expected to exhaust their state benefits before the end of June.</p> \\n\\n<p>But Obama has no quick fix. He hailed December\\'s two-year budget agreement as a breakthrough of bipartisan cooperation while his administration works with Democratic allies in the House and Senate to revive an extension of jobless benefits for those unemployed more than six months.</p> \\n\\n<p>The Obama administration says those payments have kept 11.4 million people out of poverty and benefited almost 17 million children. The cost of them since 2008 has totaled $225 billion.</p> \\n\\n<p>At the depth of the recession, laid off workers could qualify for up to 99 weeks of benefits, including the initial 26 weeks provided by states. The most recent extension allowed a total of up to 73 weeks, depending on the state.</p> \\n\\n<p>Restoring up to 47 extra weeks of benefits through 2014 would cost $19 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.</p> \\n\\n<p>House Democrats led by Reps. Sander Levin of Michigan and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland sought to include an extension through March by offsetting the costs with potential farm bill savings. They were rebuffed.</p> \\n\\n<p>Senate Democrats and some Republicans plan another push in 2014. Sens. Jack Reed, D-R.I., and Dean Heller, R-Nev., have introduced a bill offering a similar three-month extension, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has promised to bring it up. But as with much in Congress, an extension is no sure thing.</p> \\n\\n<p>In phone calls on Dec. 27, Obama told Reed and Heller he was glad they were working together to address the problem. \"It defies economic sense, precedent and our values,\" Obama economic adviser Gene Sperling said in a statement.</p> \\n\\n<p>House Speaker John Boehner spoke with Obama about an extension in December. Boehner and said his caucus would consider the possibility \"as long as it\\'s paid for and as long as there are other efforts that will help get our economy moving once again.\" He said White House has yet to introduce a plan that meets his standards.</p> \\n\\n<p>For other Republicans, the bar is higher. Many of them look at signs of economic growth and an unemployment rate now down to 7 percent and expected to drop further as evidence the additional weeks of benefits are no longer necessary.</p> \\n\\n<p>The effect of jobless benefits on the unemployment rates has been fiercely debated for decades. To qualify, people have to be seeking work. Tea partiers such as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky argue that the payments aggravate rather than relieve unemployment.</p> \\n\\n<p>The benefits allow some jobseekers to hold out for higher wages. Without the benefits, they might accept lower-paying jobs, reducing the unemployment rate. Others may be looking for work only to keep the benefits flowing and will drop out of the job market entirely once the checks stop. In theory, that also would push the unemployment rate lower.</p> \\n\\n<p>The flip side is that the benefits - in addition to alleviating suffering - get spent on consumer goods, stimulating the economy and creating jobs.</p> \\n\\n<p>Extended unemployment insurance \"is really a lifeline to help pay the bills, put food on the table, and put gas in the tank so people can look for work,\" argued Maurice Emsellem, policy co-director at the left-leaning National Employment Law Project.</p> \\n\\n<p>Michael Feroli, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase, said ending the extended benefits will lower the unemployment rate by half a percentage point as the long-term unemployed leave the labor force. While that statistical change may look good on the surface, Feroli cautioned the drop could be accompanied by a similar decrease in consumer spending. That would also hurt clothing retailers, car dealers and other Main Street businesses.</p> \\n\\n<p>Extending the program, on the other hand, would boost GDP growth by some 0.2 percent and increase full-time employment by 200,000 next year, the Congressional Budget Office estimated, but at the price of increasing the government\\'s debt.</p> \\n\\n<p>Advocates of extended benefits say communities hardest hit by the recession will feel the sudden loss of cash in circulation the most.</p> \\n\\n<p>They cite a set of their own troublesome figures: three jobseekers still competing for each opening; some 4 million people in the ranks of long-term unemployed; unemployment lasting on average 37 weeks, two months longer than most states provide insurance.</p> \\n\\n<p>___</p> \\n\\n<p>Associated Press writer Josh Lederman in Honolulu contributed to this report.&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>Copyright 2013 The Associated Press</p> \\n\\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p><a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Contact author</a></p> \\n\\n<p>&amp;#160;&amp;#160; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">economy</a>, <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">employment news</a>, <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">jobless benefits</a>, <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Recession</a>, <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">unemployment benefits</a>, <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">unemployment insurance</a>, <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">unemployment news</a></p>',\n",

Asked about plans for a four-legged addition to the White House, Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Melania Trump, said in a statement: &#8220;The first family is still getting settled so there are no plans at this time.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>If Trump stays pet-free, he will be breaking with a long held tradition of presidential pet ownership.</p> \\n\\n<p>President Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#8217;s had his beloved terrier Fala. President George H.W. Bush&#8217;s English springer spaniel Millie was featured on &#8220;The Simpsons.&#8221; When President Barack Obama&#8217;s family acquired their Portuguese water dog Bo, it was big news.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;In the modern-day presidency, almost all of them have had a pet,&#8221; said Jennifer Pickens, a White House social expert who wrote &#8220;Pets at the White House.&#8221; Still, she noted, &#8220;all didn&#8217;t necessarily have them at the beginning of the administration.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Power and pets have long gone hand in hand.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;For some reason people in power, they end up suffocating different opinions and dominating their staff, but they in some ways long for someone who will speak up to them, and a pet will,&#8221; said Doug Wead, a former George H.W. Bush administration staffer who wrote books on presidential children and the 2016 campaign.</p> \\n\\n<p>Wead noted that political pets can sometimes be used for, well, politics. He recalled an event after Millie had puppies that was &#8220;carefully choreographed so guests could see all these little puppies.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;It was calculated like a state dinner,&#8221; he said.</p> \\n\\n<p>While there have been notable pets in the White House for generations, Millie was the first modern White House dog, said Pickens. She added that Barbara Bush was the first one to &#8220;use the pet as a tool to reach out.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The former first lady wrote &#8220;Millie&#8217;s Book: As Dictated to Barbara Bush,&#8221; which reached the number one spot on the New York Times nonfiction best seller list in the fall of 1990. The newspaper&#8217;s description: &#8220;The memoirs of the English springer spaniel who lives in the White House.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Hillary Rodham Clinton in 1998 followed Bush&#8217;s lead, with a children&#8217;s book about family dog Buddy and cat Socks. &#8220;Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids&#8217; Letters to the First Pets&#8221; featured photographs of the pets, details on their habits and more than 50 letters from children to the pets.</p> \\n\\n<p>During President George W. Bush&#8217;s administration, when the White House was closed for tours after 9/11, the administration tried to connect with the public through videos. Among them was the &#8220;Barney Cam&#8221; series of short videos featuring the Scottish terrier having adventures in the West Wing, with cameos from the first family and White House staff.</p> \\n\\n<p>When he declared victory in the 2008 presidential race, Barack Obama told his daughters: &#8220;You have earned the new puppy that&#8217;s coming with us to the White House.&#8221; Several months later, Bo joined the family, a gift from the late Sen. Ted Kennedy. Bo quickly became a household name, appearing on morning television shows and in videos promoting the White House Easter egg roll.</p> \\n\\n<p>Some notable pets belonged to first kids, including Amy Carter&#8217;s Siamese cat Misty Malarky Ying Yang and Caroline Kennedy&#8217;s pony Macaroni. The Kennedy family had a veritable menagerie of pets, complete with dogs, cats, birds, hamsters and a rabbit named Zsa Zsa.</p> \\n\\n<p>Going back in White House history, some presidential pet stories get more outlandish. According to the Presidential Pet Museum website, President Martin Van Buren was given a pair of tiger cubs that he donated to a zoo and President John Quincy Adams was presented an alligator.</p> \\n\\n<p>While Trump has not embraced presidential pet ownership, Vice President Mike Pence has picked up the slack. The Pences have a bunny, Marlon Bundo, and a cat named Pickles. Another cat named Oreo recently died. And they just added two more pets to the household &#8212; puppy Harley and cat Hazel. They also installed a beehive.</p> \\n\\n<p>Pickens said she doesn&#8217;t know that it matters if Trump gets a dog, but she said they are &#8220;effective tools to connect with the American people and I think pets help humanize the presidency.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Of course, while pet ownership can provide personal and political perks, it can also go wrong. Former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney was dogged by criticism for admitting that during a 1983 family vacation, he strapped his Irish setter &#8212; in a pet carrier &#8212; to the roof of his car for a 12-hour drive from Boston to Canada.</p>',\n",
              " 6716: '<p>U.S. District Judge Lawrence K. Karlton has denied the Drug Enforcement Administration&#8217;s motion to dismiss a civil suit brought by Philip A. Denney, MD. The case will be tried in June 2008 in Sacramento. Denney is seeking to enjoin government agents from infiltrating a medical practice under false pretenses.</p> \\n\\n<p>In the Fall of 2005, as part of an investigation run by the DEA, an agent from the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Bureau named Steven Decker and an informant controlled by the Redding Police Department visited Denney&#8217;s Redding office feigning ailments and seeking approval to medicate with marijuana. The visits to Denney were described in great detail in two &#8220;Investigative Narratives&#8221; provided to Denney by a concerned citizen. Their sole motive, the DEA contends, was to gain admittance to Dixon Herbs, a nearby dispensary that was under investigation.</p> \\n\\n<p>Whether or not he was the focus of the investigation, Denney contends, the agents&#8217; visits inhibited his ability to discuss marijuana use with patients. The First Amendment right of doctors to do so freely was upheld in a case called Conant v. Walter by two federal judges and ultimately by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeal. Denney&#8217;s suit charges that the DEA violated the Conant injunction.</p> \\n\\n<p>Denney and attorney Zenia Gilg now get to depose participants and review relevant documents. They must show that the investigators visiting his office were motivated by &#8220;retaliatory animus.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The facts of the case are set forth in a 36-page order that Karlton issued Aug. 14. Here are excerpts:</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Plaintiff Philip Denney is a physician who has been licensed to practice medicine in the state of California since 1977. Since graduating from medical school at the University of Southern California, he has practiced Family, Emergency, and Occupational Medicine. He has never been disciplined by the state medical board, nor has he had his hospital privileges revoked, suspended, or restricted &#8230;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Dr. Denney is an outspoken proponent of medical marijuana. He has been qualified to testify as an expert witness regarding the use of cannabis in at least 17 counties &#8230; has testified before the California Medical Board regarding medicinal cannabis, and is a founding member of the Society of Cannabis Clinicians.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Karlton recounts that Dixon Herbs had twice turned away undercover operatives who lacked doctors&#8217; recommendations. On September 21, 2005 a &#8220;Confidential Source&#8221; (CS) was sent to Denney&#8217;s office.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;The receptionist asked for his/her medical records, which the CS reported were unavailable because he/she had recently moved from Mississippi and that the records had been destroyed in Hurricane Katrina. The receptionist went out of the office and, it is claimed, looked at the CS&#8217;s vehicle to confirm that it had Mississippi license plates, which it did.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Thereafter, Dr. Denney examined the CS, whose chief complaint was a pinched sciatic nerve that caused chronic pain. Dr. Denney asked if he/she attempted other mainstream prescription medications, and was told that he/she did, but that these medications caused stomach problems. Plaintiff then indicated that the CS was a candidate for the medical use of marijuana and explained that it was to be used only as recommended, not as a recreational drug. He then gave the CS a written recommendation.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;While the CS was inside, an investigator surveilled the office from the street. Although fitting the CS with a covert transmitter or monitoring device had apparently been considered, the investigators decided against it because the transaction was to take place within a doctor&#8217;s office. Before the CS entered the office, the investigators checked him for contraband and money and established a prearranged meeting point where they were to meet after he left plaintiff&#8217;s office &#8230;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;On November 9, 2005, defendants DEA Agent Dennis Hale, ATF Agent Steven Decker, and Redding Police Officers Tracy Miller and Eric Wallace conducted a briefing regarding the procurement of a medical marijuana recommendation from plaintiff. Agent Decker was chosen to procure the marijuana recommendation and use it at Dixon Herbs because he was the only conveniently available agent with an appropriate undercover identity. The investigators then approached plaintiff&#8217;s office and surveilled it while Agent Decker was inside.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Using a false driver&#8217;s license, Agent Decker told plaintiff&#8217;s receptionist that his name was Steven Hoffmaster. When asked for prior medical records, he stated that he had been to a hospital in Santa Clara but could not recall which one. The receptionist called several hospitals in Santa Clara but found no record of a Steven Hoffmaster. Agent Decker was told that the examination could proceed while the receptionist tried to locate his prior medical records.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;During the examination, Agent Decker told Dr. Denney that he had been in a motorcycle accident, which caused him to have daily pain in his neck. Agent Decker then showed plaintiff a scar on his neck, the product of the alleged motorcycle accident. After the examination, Dr. Denney provided a written recommendation to Agent Decker approving the use of medical marijuana &#8230;.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;The crux of plaintiff&#8217;s First Amendment claim is that defendants engaged in an investigation of his medical practice as an act of retaliation for his speech concerning medical marijuana. In Conant, the Ninth Circuit upheld a permanent injunction enjoining the government from revoking a physician&#8217;s license to prescribe controlled substances based solely on the physician&#8217;s professional recommendation of the use of medical marijuana, and, as particularly relevant here, from conducting an investigation of a physician based on the same impermissible source of sound medical information.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Conant further rejected the government&#8217;s argument that the injunction against investigations of physicians would hamper law enforcement efforts. &#8216;Because a doctor&#8217;s recommendation does not itself constitute illegal conduct, the portion of the injunction barring investigations solely on that basis does not interfere with the federal government&#8217;s ability to enforce its laws.&#8217; Furthermore, the Conant injunction does not bar investigations where the government has a good faith belief that it has substantial evidence of criminal conduct.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Although Conant arose against the backdrop of a federal policy of revoking the drug prescription licenses of doctors who recommend marijuana, its holding, contrary to the federal defendants&#8217; portrayal, is not limited to license revocation. Rather, the district court also forbade any investigation of a doctor solely on the basis that he or she recommended medical marijuana. In other words, an investigation motivated by disagreement with the doctor&#8217;s speech, even if not directly connected to the ultimate objective of license revocation, is nevertheless barred by the Conant injunction.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>What Denney Needs to Prove</p> \\n\\n<p>Denney must overcome three hurdles, according to Karlton:</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;In order to prove a retaliatory claim, plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) defendants possessed an impermissible motive to interfere with this First Amendment rights, (2) that defendants&#8217; conduct would chill a physician of ordinary firmness from future first Amendment activities, and (3) that the defendants would not have engaged in the conduct in question but for the retaliatory motive &#8230;&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The second hurdle is very low. Doctors tend to be conservative and a physician of ordinary firmness (no sexist remarks, please) would not do anything s/he thinks might displease the DEA.</p> \\n\\n<p>The other two hurdles seem not only high but unfair from the victim&#8217;s perspective. What&#8217;s motive got to do with it? If a hit man shoots the wrong person by mistake, what does it matter to the victim that he wasn&#8217;t the intended target? The DEA asserted in its motion to dismiss and will argue at trial that the surreptitious visits to Dr. Denney were incidental to the investigation of Dixon Herbs and that no animus motivated them. But to Denney, the realization that he&#8217;d been misled by government agents was extremely upsetting regardless of the agents&#8217; motives. After learning of the visits, his complaint states, he became more suspicious of his patients and less open in discussing marijuana use with them.</p> \\n\\n<p>Certainly in lying to Denney in order to get a desired diagnosis the agents showed disrespect for him personally and as a doctor. That disrespect, Denney argues, showed retaliatory animus and disregard for his rights under the First Amendment. And what if he and his staff had not demonstrated good practice standards? What if Amanda not asked for the (fake) patients&#8217; records and tried diligently to obtain them? What if she had accepted the agent&#8217;s cover story with a wink and a nod instead of confirming the out-of-state plates? What if a flyer advertising Dixon Herbs had been observed in Denney&#8217;s waiting room? What if Dr. Denney had told the agents who were pretending to be in pain, &#8220;There&#8217;s a dispensary in town called Dixon Herbs&#8221; and provided the address? Wouldn&#8217;t the investigation then have included his practice? The DEA claims they weren&#8217;t investigating when in fact their snoops didn&#8217;t observe anything incriminating.</p> \\n\\n<p>Denney and Gilg will seek to show that &#8220;retaliatory animus&#8221; has driven DEA policy towards medical marijuana ever since the passage of Prop 215 in November, 1996. (The following month DEA Administrator Thomas Constantine met with California officials to plan opposition to its implementation.) Perhaps they can call a mathematician to explain that Denney&#8217;s medical practice and the Dixon Herbs dispensary are, from the DEA&#8217;s perspective, in the same set -businesses that facilitate access to marijuana for medical use. The DEA has a retaliatory animus towards the whole set, as proven by policy statements defining marijuana as a dangerous drug with no medical use whatsoever.</p> \\n\\n<p>Karlton&#8217;s order continues:</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Defendants maintain that the purpose of the undercover visits was not to investigate plaintiff, but merely to obtain written marijuana recommendations so that they could buy marijuana at Dixon Herbs and make a criminal case against Ron Dixon. As support, they note that a Redding Police Department CI who had previously attempted to enter Dixon Herbs without a recommendation was barred from doing so. Furthermore, the DEA CS only went to plaintiff&#8217;s office after being first turned away from Dixon Herbs and then referred to plaintiff&#8217;s office.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;In response, plaintiff argues that the visits to his office bore all the traditional hallmarks of an investigation. For example, plaintiff notes that when the CI was in the medical office, an agent was outside conducting surveillance. Furthermore, although a covert transmitter and monitoring device was not used, it was at least considered. Additionally, the CI was searched before and after the office visit, the police report described the incident as a &#8216;controlled buy of a marijuana prescription,&#8217; and recorded funds were used.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;While there may have been other reasons for the defendants&#8217; meticulous care in procuring a marijuana recommendation from plaintiff and preserving an ostensible chain of custody, there is at least a genuine dispute that defendants were investigating plaintiff. This is true in spite of the declaration of Dennis Hale, the federal case agent, which states that there has been no investigation of plaintiff. The intent to inhibit speech, like the existence of a conspiracy, can be demonstrated here through direct or circumstantial evidence, and here, the circumstance at least permit the inference that plaintiff was under investigation for his speech concerning medical marijuana &#8230;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;This remains a factual dispute even if, as the federal defendants argue, they had not heard of Dr. Denney until a man at Dixon Herbs referred the CS to plaintiff&#8217;s office. Although under such circumstances it appears fairly clear that Dr. Denney was not the target of the investigation when it began, this does not foreclose the possibility that the investigation expanded to include him once the CS was referred by Dixon Herbs to plaintiff&#8217;s office. What matters for purposes of making out a First Amendment violation is that the officials possessed a retaliatory animus at the time the CS and undercover agent visited plaintiff&#8217;s office &#8230;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Plaintiff has identified the specific defendants allegedly involved, the nature and time of the alleged investigative activities (sending a CS on Sept. 21, 2005 and an undercover agent on Nov. 9, 2005) and the manner in which plaintiff was affected. This is a sufficient factual allegation from which a fact-finder could infer the existence of a conspiracy.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Second, defendants argue that plaintiff has not proven that a physician of ordinary firmness would be deterred from speaking about medical marijuana in light of two undercover visits. Defendants assert that &#8216;the physician has nothing to fear so long as the physician is&#8230; not running a script mill but engaging in the practice of medicine.&#8217;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;This turns the holding of Conant on its head. Defendants&#8217; argument, if carried to its logical conclusion, would mean that the injunction in Conant was unnecessary. Because a physician&#8217;s recommendation of medical marijuana to a patient is not illegal, they should also have nothing to fear from an investigation. The problem, however, is that a physician of ordinary firmness who was only engaging in lawful speech concerning medical marijuana could, in fact, be chilled by a federal investigation. As Judge Kozinski noted in his concurrence in Conant, &#8216;Physicians are particularly easily deterred by the threat of governmental investigation and/or sanction from engaging in conduct that is entirely lawful and medically appropriate,&#8217; in part because an investigation may harm a physician&#8217;s reputation. Here, the question of whether or not a physician of ordinary firmness would be chilled by two undercover visits is, at the least, an issue on which reasonable minds could disagree.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Third, defendants argue that the element of causation is lacking. Plaintiff must plead and prove that the challenged investigative activities would not have been undertaken but for the defendants&#8217; retaliatory animus&#8230; Defendants maintain that they would have sent the undercover visitors to plaintiff&#8217;s office even without the alleged retaliatory motive&#8230; Defendants argue that there is no chain of causation to connect the alleged unconstitutional motive with the undercover visits.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Plaintiff responds that there were other methods of investigation available that would not have abridged plaintiff&#8217;s First Amendment rights. For example, plaintiff maintains that defendants could have forged a medical marijuana recommendation, just as law enforcement creates false identity documents for undercover agents. Alternately, plaintiff suggests that law enforcement could have openly enlisted plaintiff&#8217;s assistance without fraud or deception.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Karlton questioned the efficacy of these options. A forged recommendation, he noted, &#8220;could be exposed by a confirmation phone call to Dr. Denney&#8217;s office,&#8221; And asking for Denney&#8217;s help &#8220;might have compromised the secrecy of the investigation.&#8221; Still, Karlton went on, Denney has a right to &#8220;develop an evidentiary basis to support his claim.&#8221; In other words, he has a right to depose the agents and read their files relevant to their visiting his office.</p> \\n\\n<p>In order to get an injunction preventing the government from sending undercover agents into his practice in the future, &#8220;plaintiff must prove (1) injury in fact, (2) causation, and (3) redressability.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Denney alleges that the undercover visit harmed him in two ways, Karlton wrote:</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Made him fearful of discussing the medical benefits of marijuana with his patients [and] made him suspicious of his patients, some of whom he has turned away for fear that they were using false identification provided by law enforcement. Defendants respond that whereas criminal prosecution can threaten liberty, mere investigations cannot. Furthermore, defendants argue that suspicion and anxiety do not constitute cognizable injury &#8230; The court disagrees. If harm to a doctor&#8217;s ability to &#8216;speak frankly and openly to patients,&#8217; was not a cognizable injury, the Conant injunction would never have issued in the first instance.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>As for causation,</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Dr. Denney&#8217;s suspicions were roused only upon the defendants&#8217; undercover visits and his discovery of the same. These visits were the but-for cause of his self-censorship, and an injunction would clearly restore Dr. Denney&#8217;s confidence in his relationships with his patients.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Defendants argue that emotional distress caused by an investigation is not irreparable harm &#8230; but the harms of an investigation were sufficiently irreparable to justify the injunction upheld in Conant. Damages would be an inadequate remedy because they could not reassure Dr. Denney that similar investigative tactics will not be used in the future.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Dr. Denney says that&#8217;s fine with him. His goals are political, not financial. He&#8217;s seeking to defend the Bill of Rights.</p> \\n\\n<p>FRED GARDNER edits O&#8217;Shaughnessy&#8217;s, the journal of cannabis in clinical practice.

Democrats held all of the governors&#8217; offices and Senate seats in the region. Yet by 1972, Richard Nixon carried more than 70 percent of the vote in the Deep South. Today, it&#8217;s rare to find Democrats holding top political offices in the South. The <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/congress/article24777049.html\" type=\"external\">sweep</a>&amp;#160;has been nearly complete.</p> \\n\\n<p>With a vise-like grip on the South came a large number of electoral votes but also baggage, most especially having to do with the symbols of the Old Confederacy. This was true in South Carolina, where Democrats were responsible for first flying the Confederate flag over the state capitol in 1962 but which Republicans soon became associated with.</p> \\n\\n<p>The flag became a political problem for Republicans as the nation became more ethnically and racially diverse and less culturally accepting of the symbols of slavery. For several election cycles, Republican presidential candidates refused to criticize flying the Confederate flag on state grounds for fear of losing the South Carolina primary. This stance, however, sent an alienating message to minorities and suburban voters: Key Republicans were publicly agnostic when it came to a symbol of white supremacy and secession. In a rather odd historical inversion, the party of Lincoln became identified with the symbol of slavery.</p> \\n\\n<p>And then, in the blink of an eye, it was over. An issue in which the battle lines had been long drawn suddenly changed. Why?</p> \\n\\n<p>As many people have pointed out, the proximate cause was a tragedy: Nine African-Americans gunned down during a Bible Study at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston. The alleged killer, Dylann Roof, is a racist who had been photographed posing with the Confederate flag. But, by itself, that set of facts wouldn&#8217;t have changed much at all&amp;#160;since no one could plausibly blame the Confederate flag for the massacre.</p> \\n\\n<p>Something else was at play: The way the people of Charleston responded in the aftermath of the killings. No riots. No violence. No unrest. Instead, there were calls for unity and solidarity. But even that, by itself, would not have been enough.</p> \\n\\n<p>The key event occurred when the relatives of people slain were able, less than 48 hours after the killings, to speak directly to&amp;#160;Roof at his first court appearance. It was a sublime moment. Grieving family members <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/06/19/i-forgive-you-relatives-of-charleston-church-victims-address-dylann-roof/\" type=\"external\">spoke</a> in honest, unaffected ways about the grief and heartache of their loss, and yet they somehow found it within themselves to bestow forgiveness on the man who had killed their beloved.</p> \\n\\n<p>The people and the politicians of South Carolina, having witnessed this profound demonstration of grace, wanted to find a way to extend it to others. They did. South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley &#8211; who had previously rebuffed efforts to remove the flag from the grounds of the state legislature &#8211; reversed her position, acknowledging that what had occurred &#8220;calls upon us to look at this in a different way.&#8221; She added, &#8220;By removing a symbol that divides us, we can move forward as a state in harmony and we can honor the nine blessed souls who are in heaven.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>This change in policy didn&#8217;t come about because of pressure and coercion and intimidation from without; it arose from a change of heart from within. So powerful was it that other states, including Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia, took steps to put aside the symbols of the Confederacy.</p> \\n\\n<p>While not nearly as historically significant and on a vastly smaller scale, there are some parallels to what happened a few weeks ago in Charleston and the Civil Rights era, when the most direct challenge to segregation came from within the Christian tradition and the black church. There was a profound dignity and strength in how those opposing segregation carried themselves.</p> \\n\\n<p>Martin Luther King, Jr. eschewed violence and spoke instead about justice and love. &#8220;The strong person is the person who can cut off the chain of hate, the chain of evil,&#8221; King said in a stunning 1957 <a href=\"http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/documentsentry/doc_loving_your_enemies/\" type=\"external\">sermon</a>&amp;#160;on loving your enemy. &#8220;Somebody must have religion enough and morality enough to cut it off and inject within the very structure of the universe that strong and powerful element of love.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>A few weeks ago, in a courtroom in Charleston, a handful of saints decided to cut off the chain of hate and injected the element of love. In doing so, they moved hearts in a state and a nation. They caused people to alter old assumptions.

He has no governing agenda and no attachment to any political philosophy. He merely makes it up as he goes. One of the most striking things about Trump &#8211; based on his debate performances, his interviews with newspaper reporters and editorial boards, his speeches and his television interviews &#8211; is that even now, he has given no thought to public policies.</p> \\n\\n<p>To cite just one example, in the course of several hours he changed his position <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/trump-flip-flops-skilled-worker-visas-times-day-article-1.2553190\" type=\"external\">multiple times</a>&amp;#160;on one issue (high skill immigration).

No exceptions.&#8221;)</p> \\n\\n<p>This kind of thing has been replayed over and over again, on issue after issue. But no matter; we&#8217;re supposed to overlook that, according to&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/mr-trump-goes-to-washington-1463096019?mg=id-wsj\" type=\"external\">columnists</a>&amp;#160;like Peggy Noonan,&amp;#160;who once believed in&amp;#160;the centrality&amp;#160;of serious ideas and&amp;#160; <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/650436.Simply_Speaking\" type=\"external\">logic</a>&amp;#160;in politics and&amp;#160;political&amp;#160;speech,&amp;#160;as&amp;#160;well as&amp;#160;&#8220; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Patriotic-Grace-What-Why-Need/dp/B002FL5HIW\" type=\"external\">patriotic grace</a>.&#8221; Now we&#8217;re told Mr. Trump, as antithetical to &#8220;patriot grace&#8221; as you will find in a politician, &#8220;understood, either intuitively or after study, that the Republican base was changing or open to change, and would expand if the party changed some policies. He declared those policies changed. And he won.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>He did, and &#8212; are we allowed to say this? &#8212; the voters got it wrong.&amp;#160;Vox populi&amp;#160;is not vox Dei. It is still remarkable to contemplate that a plurality of Republican voters, and several high-profile figures in the conservative movement, have supported and defended a candidate for president who is so proudly ignorant, so transparently uninformed, so indifferent to ideas.</p> \\n\\n<p>It was not always thus. In the 1980s, one of the Republican Party&#8217;s main sources of attraction to younger conservatives like myself was its growing reputation for intellectual seriousness. &#8220;Of a sudden,&#8221; wrote Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, in 1981, &#8220;the GOP has become a party of ideas.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Today, it is on the verge of nominating a man who is aggressively anti-intellectual, who has obvious contempt for ideas and believes they would &#8220;muddy his populist message.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Mr. Trump is right; they would. And that&#8217;s the problem, isn&#8217;t it? His &#8220;populist message&#8221; is all affect, all bluster, all bread and circuses. As Gertrude Stein said of Oakland, &#8220;there is no there there.&#8221; Yet it not only didn&#8217;t matter; it turned out to be an essential part of Trump&#8217;s appeal. That&#8217;s a problem, whether we&#8217;re talking about blue-collar voters in Cleveland or affluent columnists living on the Upper East Side.</p> \\n\\n<p>Peter Wehner is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.

He then went on to demonstrate good reasons for such contempt.</p> \\n\\n<p>Legrain tells readers:</p> \\n\\n<p>Experts are, of course, known to make mistakes. But in this case, the people who voted for Brexit will pay a big price for ignoring economic expertise. The harmful effects of this vote are both immediate and lasting.</p> \\n\\n<p>Britons are already worse off. The pound has&#8212;so far&#8212;plunged by nearly 9 percent against the dollar, slashing the value of British assets, with higher import prices likely to follow. The stock market has also taken a hit. The prices of property, most British people&#8217;s main asset, are almost certain to fall, too.</p> \\n\\n<p>Actually, the pound&#8217;s fall was a necessary and good development in the long run, even if it would have been better had it occurred over a longer period of time. The UK was running a trade deficit in the neighborhood of <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2016/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=33&amp;amp;pr.y=10&amp;amp;sy=2007&amp;amp;ey=2017&amp;amp;scsm=1&amp;amp;ssd=1&amp;amp;sort=country&amp;amp;ds=.&amp;amp;br=1&amp;amp;c=112&amp;amp;s=NGDP_RPCH%2CPCPIEPCH%2CTX_RPCH%2CTXG_RPCH%2CLE%2CBCA_NGDPD&amp;amp;grp=0&amp;amp;a=\" type=\"external\">5.0 percent of GDP</a> (equivalent to about $900 billion in the US); this was unsustainable. And, contrary to what Legrain claims in this piece, the best way to get the trade deficit down is to lower the value of the pound.</p> \\n\\n<p>Legrain incorrectly asserts that the drop in the pound in 2008 did not lead to a reduction in the trade deficit. In fact, it led to a substantial reduction, although with a 1&#8211;2 year lag, as would be expected. (The pound fell from a peak of <a href=\"http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=GBP&amp;amp;to=EUR&amp;amp;view=10Y\" type=\"external\">more than 1.5 euros in 2007</a> to just over 1.0 euro at its trough in 2008. It remained low until it began to rise sharply in 2013, reaching values of more than 1.4 euros last year, hence the large rise in the trade deficit.)</p> \\n\\n<p>An inflow of money from abroad was fueling a housing bubble in the UK. This has priced many people out of the real estate market. Bubbles do burst, often with very bad outcomes. The problem with bubbles is not the factor that causes them to burst; the problem is allowing them to grow in the first place.</p> \\n\\n<p>Apparently the &#8220;experts&#8221; in the UK had no idea that real estate markets could develop bubbles, or that their bursting could lead to harm. The problem Legrain describes here is entirely on the shoulders of the experts, not the Brexiters.</p> \\n\\n<p>It is also worth noting that a high stock market is not an economic good. It is a distributional measure. It means that the owners of stock have more claim on society&#8217;s income. There is very little direct relationship between the stock market&#8217;s value and investment. (In the US, the investment share of GDP peaked in the late 1970s, when the stock market was in the doldrums.)</p> \\n\\n<p>The piece also implies that the UK will face punitive tariffs from the EU after it leaves. This is possible, but the fault will then be with the EU leadership.

Few political supporters of nuclear power appear&amp;#160;to be aware that nuclear power is in free-fall around the world &#8211; especially in Western Europe and in the US, where many reactors are being closed without replacement.</p> \\n\\n<p>Few seem aware of the legal, technical, regulatory, and economic difficulties faced by utilities in building the handful of new reactors and of the crippling costs of shutting down the many old ones. None appears aware of nuclear&#8217;s financial meltdown across the globe.</p> \\n\\n<p>In a perceptive new article published by a prestigious US Ivy League University,&amp;#160; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Is Nuclear Power Coming To An End?</a>&amp;#160;Fred Pearce, a distinguished UK science writer, wrote: &#8220;Now come the bankruptcies. In an astonishing hammer blow to a global industry in late March 2017, Westinghouse &#8211; the original developer of the workhorse of the global nuclear industry, the pressurized-water reactor (PWR), and for many decades the world&#8217;s largest provider of nuclear technology -filed for bankruptcy after hitting big problems with its latest reactor design, the AP1000.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Largely as a result, its parent company, the Japanese nuclear engineering giant Toshiba, is also in dire financial straits and admits there is &#8216;substantial doubt&#8217; about its ability to continue as a going concern.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Meanwhile, France&#8217;s state-owned &#201;lectricit&#233; de France (EDF), Europe&#8217;s biggest builder and operator of nuclear power plants, is deep in debt thanks to its own technical missteps and could become a victim of the economic and energy policies of incoming President Emmanuel Macron.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;This is no short-term trend. While gas and renewables get cheaper, the price of nuclear power only rises. This is in large part to meet safety concerns linked to past reactor disasters like Chernobyl and Fukushima and to post-9/11 security worries, and also a result of utilities factoring in the costs of decommissioning their aging reactors.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Pearce concludes by stating &#8220;&#8230;the industry is in crisis. It looks ever more like a 20th-Century industrial dinosaur, unloved by investors, the public, and policymakers alike. The crisis could prove terminal.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Most British politicians sail along blissfully innocent of nuclear&#8217;s impending denouement, not only in the rest of the world but in the UK too.

But for those who know baseball, there are others: the epic 14-inning Game Three of the 2005 World Series between the Chicago White Sox and Houston Astros, in which starter Mark Buehrle came out of the bullpen to finish the game; the classic Game 7 in 2002 in which Florida defeated Cleveland; Game Seven of the 1991 World Series, when the Minnesota Twins&#8217; Jack Morris pitched ten of the guttiest innings in baseball history, shutting the Atlanta Braves out for ten innings before the Twins won in the tenth, and myriad others.</p> \\n\\n<p>The greatest argument for extra-innings being left alone is this: the most incredible pitching performance in baseball history occurred in an extra-inning game on May 26, 1959.</p> \\n\\n<p>Pittsburgh Pirates starter Harvey Haddix, facing the powerful lineup of the Milwaukee Braves, who had won the World Series in 1957 and reached the World Series in 1958 and had two Hall of Famers, Hank Aaron and Eddie Mathews, threw a perfect game for 12 innings. Many years later, Braves pitcher Bob Buhl <a href=\"http://www.si.com/vault/2009/06/01/105819842/the-greatest-game-ever-pitched\" type=\"external\">revealed</a> a player in Milwaukee\\'s bullpen had been stealing the Pirates\\' signals, hanging a towel up to signal fastball or breaking ball, and it didn&#8217;t help.</p> \\n\\n<p>Meanwhile Braves starter Lew Burdette wasn&#8217;t throwing a perfect game, but he was still shutting the Pirates out, scattering 12 hits. In the bottom of the 13th inning, Pirates third baseman Don Hoak made an error. Mathews, one of the greatest home run hitters in baseball history, bunted Felix Mantilla to second base; Aaron was intentionally walked, and then powerful Joe Adcock hit a walk-off home run. Aaron thought the ball bounced off the wall, so he cut across the diamond to return to the dugout instead of rounding the bases. Because Adcock had passed him and Aaron had left the basepaths, they were called out; Mantilla&#8217;s run was the only one counted, and the game ended 1-0.</p> \\n\\n<p>It was bad enough when baseball soiled itself by adding the designated hitter; this new idea is far worse, a violation of the spirit of the game.</p> \\n\\n<p>Stay true to yourself, baseball.</p>',\n",

They were homeless. They had no money. They had no place to live. And so, you&#8217;re not left with that many options when you are in that situation.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s difficult to put numbers on an underground industry like sex trafficking.

And if someone is going to pay good money, lots of money, somebody else is going to bring a product to that market, and unfortunately a national or international kind of natural disaster like we&#8217;ve seen, especially in the hurricanes, will bring a market.

Franklin remembers working&amp;#160;out here, when something changed. The internet. She remembers her own trafficker started moving girls off the street.

              " 6965: '<p>Alana Goodman&#8217;s <a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/politics/the-hillary-letters/\" type=\"external\">revelation</a> at the Washington Free Beacon of previously unknown correspondence between Hillary Clinton and Saul Alinsky shows that Clinton has not been honest about her far-left past. The lost Alinsky letters also remind us of what we ought to know but have forgotten: Hillary is not &#8220;Clintonian.&#8221; While Bill and Hillary have worked, schemed, and governed as a couple for decades, Hillary has always been to the left of Bill. As president, she would govern more like Obama than like her husband.</p> \\n\\n<p>Hillary Clinton was the Elizabeth Warren of her day, the leader of the left-wing of the Democratic party. Hillary continually pressed Bill from the left during their White House years, while clashing on the inside with Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and the administration&#8217;s Wall Street contingent.</p> \\n\\n<p>The difference between Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren is that Warren flouts her ideology, thrilling the base by making the leftist case as few other Democrats dare. Ever the Alinskyite, Hillary prefers to achieve leftist ends incrementally, in pragmatic guise. It&#8217;s a conflict of means rather than ends, the same conflict that leads many leftists to doubt Obama&#8217;s ideological credentials, when in fact the president is as much a man of the left as ever.</p> \\n\\n<p>Alinsky&#8217;s original quarrel with the young radicals of the 1960s, which Hillary alludes to in her letter, was over the New Left&#8217;s tendency to make noise rather than get things done. Working effectively, Alinsky believed, requires ideological stealth, gradualism, and pragmatic cover. In his day, Alinsky took hits from more openly leftist ideologues for his incrementalist caution, as Obama and Hillary do now. Yet he was no more a centrist than his two most famous acolytes are today.</p> \\n\\n<p>Glenn Reynolds links to a tweet in response to the Goodman story by Politico&#8217;s Glenn Thrush: &#8220;Remind me again why liking Saul Alinsky is unacceptable.&#8221; Alright Glenn, and the rest of a Democratic-leaning media that will do everything in its power to play this revelation down, I&#8217;ll remind you.</p> \\n\\n<p>Alinsky was a democratic socialist. He worked closely for years with Chicago&#8217;s Communist party and did everything in his power to advance its program. Most of his innovations were patterned on Communist-party organizing tactics. Alinsky was smart enough never to join the party, however. From the start, he understood the dangers of ideological openness. He was a pragmatist, but a pragmatist of the far left. (See Chapter Four of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Spreading-Wealth-Robbing-Suburbs-Cities/dp/1595230920/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1343392908&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=%22Spreading+the+Wealth%22\" type=\"external\">Spreading the Wealth</a> for details.)</p> \\n\\n<p>Hillary Clinton understood all of this. As she noted at the conclusion of her undergraduate thesis on Alinsky, &#8220;If the ideals Alinsky espouses were actualized, the result would be social revolution.&#8221; In her letter to Alinsky, Hillary says, &#8220;I have just had my one-thousandth conversation&#8221; about Reveille for Radicals (Alinsky&#8217;s first book). Nowadays, people focus on Alinsky&#8217;s more famous follow-up, Rules for Radicals. But Reveille, which Hillary knew inside-out, is the more ideologically revelatory work.</p> \\n\\n<p>Here&#8217;s how Alinsky defined his favored politics in Reveille for Radicals:</p> \\n\\n<p>Radicals want to advance from the jungle of laissez-faire capitalism to a world worthy of the name of human civilization. They hope for a future where the means of economic production will be owned by all of the people instead of the comparative handful.</p> \\n\\n<p>So Alinsky supported the central Marxist tenet of public ownership of the means of production. Unlike the New Left, however, Alinsky had no expectation of reaching that end through swift or violent revolution. He meant to approach the ultimate goal slowly, piecemeal, perhaps over generations, through patient organizing efforts at the local level.</p> \\n\\n<p>Hillary has made much of the fact that she turned away from Alinskyite organizing to seek change from within the political system instead. What these new letters show is that this was also a change of means rather than ends. Hillary&#8217;s belief in Alinsky&#8217;s goals, and her willingness to adopt and adapt his methods in a political context, remained strong.</p> \\n\\n<p>In this, Hillary has much in common with Obama and other modern Alinskyites. Alinsky wanted community organizers to shun electoral politics. Yet, as I showed in&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/redirect/amazon.p?j=1439155089\" type=\"external\">Radical-in-Chief</a>, Alinsky&#8217;s New Left followers found ways to combine his methods with electoral politics. This synthesis of Alinskyism and electoral politics, pioneered by Alinsky&#8217;s acolytes in Chicago, is what inspired Obama&#8217;s career. Hillary was part of the same wave. Despite her attempts to use her choice of electoral politics as evidence of distancing from Alinsky, these letters make clear that she never lost the faith.</p> \\n\\n<p>Hillary&#8217;s newly&amp;#160;discovered letter to Alinsky was written while she was doing a summer internship at the left-wing law firm of Treuhaft, Walker, and Bernstein. As Carl Bernstein points out in A Woman in Charge: The Life of Hillary Rodham Clinton, Hillary hasn&#8217;t been honest about this episode either. Bernstein quotes Treuhaft saying that of the firm&#8217;s four partners, &#8220;two were communists, and others tolerated communists.&#8221; Yet none acknowledged party membership until years later.</p> \\n\\n<p>Whether Hillary knew about those memberships or not, the firm was obviously very far on the left. They represented some of the Black Panther Party leadership and other left-wing causes as well. &#8220;There was no reason except politics for a girl from Yale&#8221; to intern at the firm, Treuhaft told Bernstein. &#8220;She certainly&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;was in sympathy with all the left causes,&#8221; he continued. Yet as Bernstein notes, in her memoir Hillary took pains to gloss over &#8220;anything that could be construed as resembling a radical or leftist past.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>During her time in Arkansas, Hillary may seem to have moved to the center. The Rose Law Firm, after all, was nothing like Treuhaft, Walker, and Bernstein. It was an establishment law firm representing the most powerful economic interests in the state. With the help of Dick Morris, moreover, Hillary took on the Arkansas teachers&#8217; unions from the right as she led Bill&#8217;s education initiative during his final governorship. In retrospect, all of this was largely pragmatic positioning. When Hillary finally got to the White House and <a href=\"http://www.claremont.org/article/dj-two/#.VCAmkI10wVU\" type=\"external\">assumed the co-presidency</a>, she veered sharply back to the left on a whole range of issues, especially Hillarycare.</p> \\n\\n<p>The same pattern will repeat itself should Hillary be elected president. Hillary has never abandoned her early leftist inclinations. She has merely done her best to suppress the evidence of her political past, from barring public access to her thesis on Alinsky during her time in the White House, to papering over the significance of her internship at Treuhaft, Walker, and Bernstein, to pretending that she turned away from Alinsky after her undergraduate years, when in fact she brought his methods and outlook into the heart of her political work. Her strategic preference for polarization and targeting enemies is well documented from her time in the White House, even, or especially, by sympathetic writers such as Bernstein.</p> \\n\\n<p>Hillary is fortunate in having a more open and straightforward champion of the Left like Elizabeth Warren as a foil. Yet far less separates the two of them than meets the eye. Not only have Hillary&#8217;s deepest sympathies always been on the left, but the newly ideologized Democratic party is going to pressure a President Hillary Clinton to be what she has always wanted to be.</p> \\n\\n<p>With Obamacare and much else besides, the legal and bureaucratic groundwork has already been laid for a leftist transformation of America. It is na&#239;ve to believe that Hillary would roll any of this back. On the contrary, as president she would finish the job Obama started. A Hillary presidency is destined to be Obama&#8217;s third term. Two Alinskyite presidents in a row? Hillary said it best: &#8220;The result would be a social revolution.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8212; Stanley Kurtz is a Senior Fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center</p>',\n",

Which raises the question: How relevant is adultery when it comes to choosing a president?</p> \\n\\n<p>Betrayal&#8212;or no big deal?</p> \\n\\n<p>On one end of the spectrum are those who believe the issue is open-and-shut. The argument goes like this: a person who betrays his spouse may well betray other commitments, including defending the Constitution. Unfaithfulness unquestionably bears on character, and character in public officials matters. &#8220;Betrayal is a garment without seams,&#8221; in the words of Professor Robert King. Serial infidelity can be a sign of other maladies, including narcissism and compulsiveness, recklessness and deception. And presidents, like athletes, are role models. The NFL has a personal conduct policy; shouldn&#8217;t we expect something similar for our chief executive?</p> \\n\\n<p>For others, infidelity by a politician is a matter of indifference. Presidents take an oath to uphold the Constitution, not to live by the moral commands of the Bible. And it&#8217;s often the case that infidelity has no bearing on a person&#8217;s public duties.</p> \\n\\n<p>On top of that, there are plenty of sins that are condemned in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. Why focus on infidelity instead of self-righteousness, bitterness, avarice, or lack of charity? And of course a person who cheats on his spouse might also embody virtues in other arenas (for example, battlefield valor). Some of the most important figures in American history&#8212;from Thomas Jefferson to Franklin Roosevelt to Martin Luther King, Jr.&#8212;are believed to have cheated on their wives. Should their voices have been silenced because of their indiscretions?</p> \\n\\n<p>The Churchill-Chamberlain test</p> \\n\\n<p>Assume that during World War II the choice was between an unfaithful Winston Churchill and a faithful Neville Chamberlain. With the benefit of hindsight, who would most of us prefer as prime minister? (For the record, Churchill was known to be devoted to his beloved Clementine.)</p> \\n\\n<p>There are, then, strong arguments on both sides of this debate, which is why many of us are on a continuum. Facts and circumstances are crucial. Was an act of infidelity an aberration or part of a pattern? What levels of deception and cover-up were involved? Was there abuse of power or were there unusual displays of cruelty and callousness involved? Does adultery manifest other character defects that are likely to spill over into one&#8217;s public actions?</p> \\n\\n<p>These are tricky matters to sort through. Every saint has a past and every sinner has a future, in the words of Oscar Wilde. And what role should grace and forgiveness play in all this?</p> \\n\\n<p>Cheap grace</p> \\n\\n<p>Too often, especially in politics, there is a habit to dispense what one theologian called &#8220;cheap grace.&#8221; Grace doesn&#8217;t mean ethical infractions are forgotten and never taken into account. At the same time, men are not angels. Sin afflicts us all. And most of us believe in, and all of us are in need of, redemption. How to balance grace and accountability is a matter that every one of us deals with in an imperfect and selective manner. Too often, we employ different standards based on our political affiliations and ideological predilections. We take similar facts and interpret them in very different ways, depending on how well they reflect on those whom we support versus those whom we oppose.</p> \\n\\n<p>In &#8220;The Death of Outrage,&#8221; William J. Bennett wrote, &#8220;The founders (like the ancient Greeks) believed it was important that the head of the good polity be a man of good character, and they advocated that the office of the presidency be filled by persons whose reputation for integrity inspires and merits confidence.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Mr. Bennett goes on to quote the beautiful words said of George Washington upon his death: &#8220;The purity of his private character gave effulgence to his public virtues.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>We can do better</p> \\n\\n<p>To find someone as virtuous as Washington is rare. But we should be able to do better than someone who, when asked by his then-wife (Marianne Gingrich) how he could give a speech full of high sentiments about compassion and family values while simultaneously committing infidelity, reportedly answered, &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter what I do&#8230;. It doesn&#8217;t matter what I live.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Actually, it does.</p> \\n\\n<p>Peter Wehner is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.

              " 7015: '<p /> \\n\\n<p>Some years ago, when I was Business Week\\'s columnist, an up-and-coming academic economist published his conclusions that raising the minimum wage did not cause unemployment.&amp;#160; An implication was that labor unions did not cause unemployment by forcing up wages. &amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>&amp;lt;img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-14896\" style=\"margin: 5px;\" src=\"https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Paul-Craig-Roberts.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Craig Roberts\" width=\"256\" height=\"180\" srcset=\"https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Paul-Craig-Roberts.jpg 256w, https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Paul-Craig-Roberts-150x105.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" /&amp;gt;</p> \\n\\n<p>These conclusions flew in the face of economic theory.&amp;#160; Theory held that employees were paid the value of their marginal product. The value of the marginal product of labor is a measure of labor\\'s contribution to the firm\\'s revenues. As a factory, for example, increases its work force, after initially rising, the contribution of each additional employee to output falls. Think of it in this way: as the work force expands, the fixed size of the factory means that additional workers have less technology and capital per capita with which to work.&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>Thus, after some point, the marginal product of additional workers falls. The value of the worker\\'s marginal product is his output times the price of the product.</p> \\n\\n<p>Translated, that means that employers expand the work force to the point that the last person hired adds as much value to the firm\\'s output as the cost of his wage.</p> \\n\\n<p>Therefore, arbitrarily raising wages beyond this point by legislation or strikes would mean that the last employees hired cost more than they contribute to the value of the company\\'s output. (The wage rises, but not the marginal product of labor). In other words, the work force would be downsized to the point that the value of the marginal product of the last unit of labor hired equaled the higher wage. Think of it this way: as the number of employees shrink, the capital and technology of the firm is spread among fewer workers, making them more productive.</p> \\n\\n<p>I pounded the up-and-coming economist pretty hard for his conclusions.&amp;#160; Having grown with age more skeptical of all explanations, today I probably would report his views, commend him for his courage in taking on established wisdom, and say that his findings should be examined for their correctness.</p> \\n\\n<p>Like physics, or chemistry, or law, or history, or literature, or whatever, there are far too many areas of economics for one economist to be informed about and to keep up with. I don\\'t know whether the economist I took to the woodshed prevailed and changed the theory of wage determination or whether some fault was found in his work.</p> \\n\\n<p>California entrepreneur Ron Unz has reopened the case for raising the minimum wage. Unz advocates for a $12 per hour minimum wage. Allowing for an eight-hour five-day work week with two weeks\\' vacation, this would produce an annual income of $24,000, the poverty level income for a family.</p> \\n\\n<p>Unz has received more favorable attention than I gave the academic economist back in the 1980s or 1990s.</p> \\n\\n<p>Unz <a href=\"http://www.unz.com/article/the-conservative-case-for-a-higher-minimum-wage/\" type=\"external\">makes a good case</a>. If Americans were paid a living wage for the jobs that Mexicans manage to do by living 10 to a trailer, illegal immigration would decline. Unz can convincingly argue that a higher minimum wage would actually increase the employment of American citizens as they would be able to scrape by on the wages from the higher minimum wage.</p> \\n\\n<p>I endorse Unz\\'s proposal with reservations. My doubts about a healthy rise in the minimum wage are not based on the economic theory that the value of the marginal product curve of labor is the firm\\'s demand curve for labor. Nor am I opposed to a reduction of illegal immigration or to paying people a living wage. If the working poor made enough to live on, the social welfare budget could be cut.</p> \\n\\n<p>From my standpoint, the problem with raising the minimum wage to a survivable level is that it pacifies the millions of Americans who are being oppressed by the greed of the one percent and the public officials who serve them. Making the survival of the oppressed easier keeps them from being in the streets protesting the rising inequality of income and wealth that jobs offshoring, financial deregulation, and cuts in social welfare programs such as food stamps have produced in America.</p> \\n\\n<p>The ladders of upward mobility that made America an opportunity society have been dismantled by the movement abroad of America\\'s high value-added, high productivity jobs, leaving displaced Americans with only lowly paid domestic service jobs, such as retail clerks, waitresses, bartenders, and hospital orderlies. Making low pay jobs more livable makes the dismantling of the opportunity society more acceptable.</p> \\n\\n<p>I think that Unz is correct that a significant rise in the minimum wage would both reduce illegal immigration by making it possible for Americans to survive on minimum wage jobs and provide a poverty level income for millions of Americans who currently live below the poverty line. But this amelioration of hardship suppresses protests and rebellion.</p> \\n\\n<p>To recover justice, a reasonable distribution of income, the accountability of government, corporations, and banksters to the rule of law, and to revive the growth of consumer demand on which the success of the US economy depends, the existing order that serves the one percent needs to be altered. The ladders of upward mobility must be restored.</p> \\n\\n<p>What is more imperative, a rise in the minimum wage that pacifies the work force and the downtrodden by making their survival easier, or a rising swell of disaffection that ultimately reforms or overthrows a government that is unaccountable both to law and to the people?</p> \\n\\n<p>What I learned as a Washington insider for a quarter of a century is that Washington buys compliance. By purchasing compliance Washington can continue to masquerade the US as \"the indispensable people, a light unto the world,\" while Washington murders people in half a dozen countries and destroys the infrastructure, housing, and environment of those countries, simultaneously dispossessing the American middle class, destroying civil liberty, and locking the poor into an underclass.</p> \\n\\n<p>Until the government is brought back into compliance with the rule of law and the will of the people, ameliorating hardships sustains the evil empire.</p> \\n\\n<p>Unz is a genuine reformer.&amp;#160; But reforms can have unintended consequences, and that is what worries me about raising the minimum wage.</p>',\n",

              " 7038: '<p /> \\n\\n<p>Last week, Sami Ramadani undertook the urgent task of giving Western audiences a history lesson on the supposed entrenched sectarian violence of modern Iraq. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/16/sectarian-myth-of-iraq\" type=\"external\">The Sectarian Myth of Iraq</a>, written for The Guardian, sends a message rarely acknowledged in the English speaking world: &#8220;We coexisted peacefully for centuries, and need neither brutal dictators nor western intervention.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>He explodes the illusion that Iraq and the Middle East in general is but a cauldron of historically rooted Shia-Sunni sectarian animosities, and that the current crisis is reducible to the region&#8217;s supposedly incurable religious violence&#8212;a mentality that has become a truism in the media and foreign policy establishment. This misperception spills over into common American discourse as the simplistic &#8220;Arabs hate each other,&#8221; or &#8220;this is a centuries old religious conflict.&#8221; But Ramadani&#8217;s point is proven by his wealth of historical references; his conclusions further run counter to everything Americans have been told about Iraqi society:</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;The most serious sectarian and ethnic tensions in Iraq&#8217;s modern history followed the 2003 US-led occupation, which faced massive popular opposition and resistance. The US had its own divide-and-rule policy, promoting Iraqi organisations founded on religion, ethnicity, nationality or sect rather than politics. Many senior officers in the newly formed Iraqi army came from these organisations and Saddam&#8217;s army. This was exacerbated three years ago, when sectarian groups in Syria were backed by the US, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Many in American government and media have been asking over the past week: &#8220;How do we keep getting the Middle East so wrong?&#8221; There are many avenues of approach to this question, but perhaps the simplest and most basic, confirmed in my own experience, is that Americans continue to see the region according to simplistic stereotypes, caricatures, and orientalist abstractions. American assumptions never line up with Eastern realities, yet our power combined with ignorance continues to sow disaster. It might help for American policymakers to simply travel to those places they are intent on changing, and to live among the common populace for an extended period &#8211;doing so would likely shatter many illusions.</p> \\n\\n<p>I served in the Marine Corps during the first years of the Iraq War and was a 9/11 first responder while stationed at Headquarters Battalion Quantico 2000-2004. I thought I knew something about Iraq upon the start of our new &#8220;war on terror&#8221;: Arab culture, with its intrinsic primal religious passions and resulting sectarian divisions, must be brought to heel under Western values of pluralism, secularism, and equality if peace and stability are to ever have a chance. This was a guiding assumption among the many Marine officers, active and retired, that I conversed with during my years at Quantico. Iraqis and Middle Easterners were, for us, abstractions that fit neatly into categories learned about by viewing a C-span lecture, or perhaps in a college class or two: there are Sunnis, Shia, some dissident sects, they all mistrust each other, and they all want theocratic states with their group in charge.</p> \\n\\n<p>My first visit to the region as a civilian desiring to study Arabic in 2004, after completion of active duty military service, began a process of undoing every assumption I&#8217;d ever imbibed concerning Middle East culture, politics, and conflict. An initial visit to Syria from Lebanon was the start of something that my Marine buddies could hardly conceive of: Damascus became my second home through frequent travel and lengthy stays from 2004 to 2010, and was my place of true education on the real life and people of the region. While my fellow servicemen were just across Syria&#8217;s border settling in to the impossible task of occupying a country they had no understanding of, I was able view a semblance of Iraq as it once was through the prism of highly stable Ba&#8217;athist Syria.</p> \\n\\n<p>During my first weeks in Damascus, I was pleasantly shocked at just how wrong my simplistic ideas about region were. I expected to find a society full of veiled women, mosques on every street corner, religious police looking over shoulders, rabid anti-American sentiment preached to angry crowds, persecuted Christians and crumbling hidden churches, prudish separation of the sexes, and so on. I quickly realized during my first few days and nights in Damascus, that Syria was a far cry from my previous imaginings, which were probably more reflective of Saudi Arabian life and culture.</p> \\n\\n<p>What I actually found was mostly unveiled women wearing European fashions and sporting bright makeup &#8211; many of them wearing blue jeans and tight clothes. I saw groups of teenage boys and girls mingling in trendy cafes late into the night, displaying expensive cell phones. There were plenty of mosques, but almost every neighborhood had a large church or two with crosses figured prominently in the Damascus skyline. As I walked near the Old City, I was surprised to find entire streets lined with large stone and marble churches. At night, all of the crosses atop these churches were lit up, outlined with blue fluorescent lighting, visible for miles; and in some parts of the Damascus skyline these blue crosses even outnumbered the green-lit minarets of mosques. Historic synagogues were also accessible and well-kept in the small Jewish quarter of Old City Damascus and in the famous National Museum.</p> \\n\\n<p>More surprising than the presence of prominent brightly lit churches, was the number of restaurant bars and alcohol kiosks clustered around the many city squares. One could get two varieties of Syrian-made beer, or a few international selections like Heineken or Amstel, with relative ease. The older central neighborhoods, as well as the more upscale modern suburbs, had a common theme: endless numbers of restaurants filled with carefree Syrians, partying late into the night with poker cards, boisterous discussion, alcohol, hookah smoke, cigarettes, and elaborate oriental pastries and desserts. I got to know local Syrians while frequenting random restaurants during my first few weeks in Damascus. I came into contact with people representative of Syria&#8217;s ethnically and religiously diverse capital city: Christians, Sunni Muslims, Alawites, Druze, Kurds, Armenians, Palestinians, and a number of Arab atheists. The characterization of Syrian city life that increasingly came to my mind during my first, and many subsequent visits and extended stays, was of Syria as a consciously pluralistic and secular society.</p> \\n\\n<p>Syrian cities (and government organizations) are very much like Iraq before the war: neighborhoods are mixed, and people don&#8217;t identify themselves primarily along sectarian lines; &#8220;I am Syrian&#8221; or &#8220;I am Iraqi&#8221; is typically as far as you&#8217;ll get with &#8220;identity&#8221; type discourse. In fact, it is generally considered rude to even inquire of a person&#8217;s particular religious or ethnic background in daily conversation (much as it is in most parts of the world). The secularist, pluralist, and &#8220;Syrian first&#8221; attitude, more palpably experienced in urban centers, was a far cry from the simple caricature of &#8220;passionate, sectarian, conservative Islamic society&#8221; I&#8217;d been given while in the Marines and by American culture in general.</p> \\n\\n<p>I certainly witnessed plenty of examples of Islamic conservatism in Syrian public life, but it was the secular and pluralistic (represented in the diverse population living side by side) aspect that always seemed to dominate, whether I was in Damascus, Homs, Aleppo, or coastal areas like Tartus. Syria&#8217;s committed secular identify was confirmed to me more than ever when I first traveled the freeway that wraps around Mt. Qasyoon&#8212;the small mountain against which the Damascus urban center is nestled. My speeding taxi passed a couple of expansive foreign car dealerships, but most prominent were a seeming myriad number of windowless entertainment venues, structured like residential mansions, lining both sides of the road. My taxi driver laughed at my perplexed expression and informed me that this was &#8220;brothel row&#8221; (my translation)&#8212;a place where guys go to drink and have their pick of East European, Syrian, and Iraqi women.</p> \\n\\n<p>When I later got to know a group of Syrian Christian guys&#8212;enough to where I could ask potentially awkward or embarrassing questions&#8212;they confirmed, with some degree of shame, that all big cities in Syria have their seedy underbellies (&#8220;like your Nevada,&#8221; my friend&amp;#160;Michel said). Places like brothels and &#8220;pick-up bars&#8221; were allowed to operate in public, but didn&#8217;t necessarily advertise what they were about. It was explained to me that while the Syrian government was deeply authoritarian in some respects, it generally allowed (and enforced) openness in social and religious areas unparalleled anywhere in the Middle East. I was told by many Syrians and Iraqis that Iraqi society had been little different from Syria prior to U.S. occupation. Most blamed the Americans and Western powers for the religious nature of Iraq&#8217;s resulting civil war, and the ultra-conservative path of the competing sects.</p> \\n\\n<p>Syrian Ba&#8217;ath society, like pre-invasion Iraq, was never ideal; yet, it certainly escapes the many false stereotypes that have come to define the American outlook on the region. Baghdad was very much like Damascus prior to the American invasion: Iraqi nationalism, regardless of sectarian creed, was the organizing principle of the secular Ba&#8217;ath state. It is a tragic shame that those U.S. personnel sent to occupy Iraq never got to experience the country before the 2003 invasion. They would have learned the important reality: &#8220;We coexisted peacefully for centuries, and need neither brutal dictators nor western intervention.&#8221;</p>',\n",

It was in keeping with his reputation that spanned decades as a man ahead of his time. He was just 17 years old when he joined the civil rights movement in the late 1950s, was the youngest founding member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee&amp;#160;and had his name placed in nomination for vice president at the fractious 1968 Democratic National Convention. He withdrew because he was too young to assume the office.&amp;#160; &amp;#160;&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>But Julian Bond not only made civil rights history, he chronicled it, including the history of Boston desegregation, as we heard in the 14-part Award-winning PBS series &#8220; <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/eyesontheprize/story/21_boston.html\" type=\"external\">Eyes on The Prize</a>&#8221; that was narrated by Bond.</p> \\n\\n<p>Bond was not detached from the subjects of his narration, and in my Brandeis interview with the civil rights icon, he discussed the Republican Party\\'s lambasting of President Barack Obama, voting suppression, the 1961 Freedom Riders and the <a href=\"http://www.wgbh.org/freedomRiders/notes_from_the_bus.cfm\" type=\"external\">re-creation</a> of their journey in 2011, his anger over \"the treatment of President Johnson\" in the movie \" <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1020072/\" type=\"external\">Selma</a>\" and his personal reflection on Boston&#8217;s lingering reputation for bigotry.&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p /> \\n\\n<p /> \\n\\n<p>On the election of America\\'s first black president, Bond said he never thought it could happen in the United States. He said he supported Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008, but went on to become friends with President Obama. In the process, Bond became fiercely protective of the president, whom he says has been the target of animus that can only be explained one way:</p> \\n\\n<p>BOND: &#8220;He is a black man.&amp;#160;That&#8217;s the reason he&#8217;s engendered so much animus.&amp;#160;That&#8217;s the reason people don&#8217;t like him, because he&#8217;s a black man.&amp;#160;That&#8217;s the only reason.&#8221;&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>REPORTER:&amp;#160;What makes you think that and why do you say he&#8217;s viewed (this way) as a result of the color of his skin?</p> \\n\\n<p>BOND: &#8220;I know that&#8217;s the case.&amp;#160;I can&#8217;t prove it and say here&#8217;s the reason why, this is my proof.&amp;#160;But I know it to be true.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>REPORTER:&amp;#160; &#8220;No doubt you met with the President and I&#8217;m just wondering has he ever expressed concerns about this central issue in the United States that we call race?&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>BOND: &#8220;Not to me.&amp;#160;We&#8217;ve met a couple of times together about this or that or the other thing.&amp;#160;I&#8217;ve tried to be encouraging to him because he needs, any president needs, all the encouragement he can get.&amp;#160;I don&#8217;t care who he is.&#8221;&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>Barack Obama was not the only US president whom Julian Bond befriended. In the movie \" <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Abkka8Vf2_M\" type=\"external\">Selma</a>,\" President Lyndon B. Johnson is portrayed as complicit in an effort to discredit Martin Luther King and to delay voting rights. It&#8217;s a portrayal that angered Bond.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Now if you follow politics and you know anything about President Johnson, there&#8217;s got to be things you don&#8217;t like. But one of the things you cannot dislike is Johnson&#8217;s attitude toward voting rights. He&#8217;s the best civil rights president we have ever had in this country.&amp;#160;There&#8217;s nobody better than Lyndon Johnson. And to say in this movie that he played a bad role in the struggle for voting rights is just a terrible, terrible mistake.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Bond said he was&amp;#160;angry over what he called contemporary Republican efforts to suppress the voting rights of African-Americans, Latinos and other mainstays of the Democratic Party leading up to the 2016 presidential election.&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>Remembering Julian Bond: <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">The voice of \\'Eyes on the Prize\\'</a></p> \\n\\n<p>Bond also commented on the <a href=\"http://wgbhnews.org/post/ferguson-echoes-boston-and-47-arrests-follow\" type=\"external\">Black Lives Matter</a> protests against police shootings and civilian killings of unarmed black men and women, comparing it to the <a href=\"http://www.wgbh.org/articles/Occupy-Boston-A-Week-In-The-Life-Of-A-Movement-4957\" type=\"external\">Occupy Movement.&amp;#160;</a>&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;The Occupy Movement was good but it wasn&#8217;t as good as it should be in my view.

I&#8217;m a little wary of Boston today.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>And for Bond, the Red Sox &#8212; the last major league baseball team to admit black players &#8212; was still a source of trepidation.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m married to a woman who is a tremendous sports fan and she wants to go to a baseball game.&amp;#160;And I said, &#8216;no, I don&#8217;t want to go.&amp;#160;I don&#8217;t want to go to a game there.&#8217; And it turned out in this particular case I went with her. And the people in front of us are telling us jokes &#8212; they turned out to be college students looking for recruits to their college &#8212; and they said they made sure they never told any black people about their college.&amp;#160;They didn&#8217;t want that to happen. And it just reinforced my feelings about Boston.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>I asked Bond, if he could say one thing about changing that perception of Boston to the city\\'s mayor, Marty Walsh &#8212; who realizes that this perception is a problem, and who recently accepted a <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/12/02/city-boston-gets-grant-nurture-dialogue-race/iy3mZfdfYpuMJpbJYX9W8H/story.html\" type=\"external\">$1 million grant</a>to engage communities around race, with busing as the backdrop &#8212;&amp;#160;what would it be?&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;s got to find some way, and I don&#8217;t know how he can do it, but he&#8217;s got to find some way to engage white Bostonians and tell them they&#8217;ve got to behave better,&#8221; said Bond. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got to change their way of acting and become more interested in being decent to other people; people not like them: people of color.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>But Bond also conceded his view of Boston may be framed by <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/national/articles/2008/04/04/a-flag-a-busing-fight-and-a-famous-photograph\" type=\"external\">a picture of the city</a> that many now consider outdated.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p /> \\n\\n<p /> \\n\\n<p>The civil rights legend had returned to Boston to honored with the <a href=\"http://www.brandeis.edu/richmanfellow/\" type=\"external\">2015 Richman Distinguished Fellow in Public Life Award at Brandeis University.&amp;#160;</a></p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;I never considered this would happen to me.

              " 7069: '<p>US: Obama\\'s administration, shaken by the crisis By Juan Chingo</p> \\n\\n<p>In the heat of the brutal economic crisis that destroyed another 598,000 jobs in January 2009, the enthusiasm between Obama\\'s election and his inauguration and his first days of governing has rapidly dissipated. This is one sign of the problems that he confronts and of the exceptional times we are living through. The hundred-day honeymoon that is given every new US President has not ended, but after scarcely twenty days his administration seems confused, pulled between pressure from the banks and the financial aristocracy that is running the country, to exert pressure so that the costs of the crisis fall on the shoulders of working people, whose expectations that Obama\\'s arrival in power would mean some change in their desperate situation, caused by the deterioration of economic conditions.</p> \\n\\n<p>The crisis of the chosen road of compromise</p> \\n\\n<p>For some analysts, Obama\\'s administration already appears more incompetent than Bush\\'s on its worst days. Some respected ultra-liberal bourgeois analysts, like Martin Wolf, who begins his February 11 article in the Financial Times by even wondering if Obama\\'s presidency has already failed: \"Has Barack Obama???s presidency already failed? In normal times, this would be a ludicrous question. But these are not normal times. They are times of great danger.... Today, it is in control of events; tomorrow, events will take control of it. Doing too little is now far riskier than doing too much. If he fails to act decisively, the president risks being overwhelmed, like his predecessor. The costs to the US and the world of another failed presidency do not bear contemplating.\" This incipient political crisis, a very few days after having taken office, is a result of the extremely compromising, national unity road chosen by the new President, very far from even Franklin Delano Roosevelt\\'s politics of a complete break during the Great Depression, which avoided the dissatisfaction of the masses strengthening their radicalization independently of the two big parties of the bourgeoisie, in spite of the big mobilizations that took place, although Roosevelt did not succeed in getting the economy to return to the level before the Depression. This is what can be observed both in the stimulus plan approved on Tuesday, February 10, by the Senate, the plan that on Wednesday, February 11, was harmonized with the version adopted by the House of Representatives, before being promulgated by the new President, and in the details of the new financial stability plan announced by the new US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, on the same day. On the one hand, his political choice of struggling hard for a bipartisan consensus did not get a single Republican to vote for the House version of the stimulus plan, which they denounced demagogically as a \"socialization\" of the economy that would bring with it the setting up of a European style \"welfare state,\" this coming from the right-wing Republican program, which consists of lowering taxes on the rich even further and destroying what little remains of Social Security, by transferring public money to big capital, but by other ways than those proposed by the Democrats. But their pressure on the Senate, where the Democrats had to add support from three Republican Senators, succeeded in doing away with the minimal palliatives that the plan had, in order to make it acceptable to the masses, like help for state governments, building schools, or increasing food stamps, central features of the more than 80 billion dollars that were cut from the version adopted in the House of Representatives. On the other hand, some provisions, like a tax credit for home buyers, which some analysts call the \"transfer your house to your brother\" clause, which will cost a lot of money and do nothing to boost the economy, were incorporated in the bill. Not accidentally, popular support has diminished, as shown by opinion polls before the plan\\'s approval. Neo-Keynesians like Paul Krugman, disappointed by the law that passed, blame the bipartisan strategy followed by Obama: \" ... that was his best opportunity to take decisive action, and it was cut short.\"</p> \\n\\n<p>On the other hand, the new financial rescue plan shows that Obama is as subservient to the interests of Wall Street as Bush\\'s politics were. The content of his new plan can be summarized as a \"no\" to the nationalization of the banks and to punishing investors. These are the political limits that the administration is unwilling to touch. In this connection, although Geithner is trying to present the new bailout plan, called Financial Stability Trust, as something completely different from the infamous Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) - promoted by Bush\\'s former Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson - by saying that it includes strict requirements of transparency and responsibility and harsh restrictions on banks that receive additional bailout funds, in reality, it has followed the same outline. The supposed limits on executive pay and other requirements on the banks are really largely ephemeral, designed to mitigate distrust by the population and conceal another big transfer of public resources to the financial elite. But, in spite of these guarantees for investors and bankers, no plan has ever been so openly rejected by these same groups, as shown by the severe decline of the stock market while Geithner was speaking, although on the following day they rose a little, in expectation of new details. The problem is that the lack of specificity and of a direct and open promise to get rid of bank losses at the expense of the population, inflamed scepticism and open hostility of the financial markets. As Nouriel Roubini stated, \"The weighty proposal of the US Treasury to dispose of toxic assets could be best understood as a combination of removing toxic assets from the balance sheets of the banks and giving governmental guarantees to those private investors that buy them (and/or providing public capital to finance a private-public \"bad bank\" that would buy such assets). But this plan is so non-transparent and complicated that it received disapproval from the markets as soon as it was announced today, while all the main indices of equity in the US fell sharply\" (RGE, February 10).</p> \\n\\n<p>An insolvency crisis that will begin the Second Depression, if it has not already begun</p> \\n\\n<p>The fundamental question, as we have already said innumerable times, is that we are facing a complete bankruptcy of the US and UK banking systems, as well as those of some European countries. As Martin Wolf indicates in the note quoted above: \" ... a sizeable proportion of financial institutions are insolvent: their assets are, under plausible assumptions, worth less than their liabilities. The International Monetary Fund argues that potential losses on US-originated credit assets alone are now $2,200bn (???1,700bn, \"\"1,500bn), up from $1,400bn just last October. This is almost identical to the latest estimates from Goldman Sachs. In recent comments to the Financial Times, Nouriel Roubini of RGE Monitor and the Stern School of New York University estimates peak losses on US-generated assets at $3,600bn. Fortunately for the US, half of these losses will fall abroad. But, the rest of the world will strike back: as the world economy implodes, huge losses abroad \"?\" on sovereign, housing and corporate debt \"?\" will surely fall on US institutions, with dire effects.\"</p> \\n\\n<p>The Obama administration\\'s new plan continues treating the question as if the financial crisis were only of illiquidity [\"insufficienty of cash,\" according to Webster], betting, in an unreal manner, on an improvement of economic perspectives. The risk of this policy, as the alarmed Roubini warns, is that \"The current focus of the US and Great Britain could end up resembling Japan\\'s zombie banks [1] that were never properly restructured and ended up perpetuating the credit drought and the credit freeze.\" For that reason, the guru of the current crisis is proposing nationalization, but he regrets that, for the moment, it is not politically viable. But for this to be justifiable from the point of view of capitalist property, the majority of the banks (the four biggest ones and a good part of the regional banks) would have to be clearly insolvent. Now only CitiGroup and the Bank of America seem to be in that state, but not yet JPMorgan or Wells Fargo. But this could be the reality if the economy fails to improve within 6 to 12 months, as the government yearns for. Besides the big banks, some big consulting companies like RBC Capital indicate that in the next 3 to 5 years, as many as 1,000 financial firms in the United States will close, as a result of credit granted to finance tertiary real estate investments (those intended for office space, commercial and industrial space) a category that threatens to become the next sectorial black hole. Its previous prediction was 300 firms closing. In 2008, 25 firms closed, and so far this year, 9 have done so, which implies that there will probably be 100 closings this year. The worst will come in 2010 and 2011. For its part, a report from Credit Suisse indicates that US real estate sector losses still pending will be $1.6 billion, that is, the trifle of 18% of the total US real estate market, with nonpayments especially concentrated among the Alt-A morgages, those set up with incomplete documentation.</p> \\n\\n<p>In other words, everything would still have to fall some more, for more radical measures to be acceptable. But the risk for the entire economy could be truly profound, as Roubini warns: \"Then, the current strategy - Plan A - might not work, and Plan B (or better put, Plan N of nationalization) would end up being the road to follow later on, this year. Wasting another 6 to 12 months to do the right thing could be an error, but the political restrictions facing the new administration - and the slight remaining possibility that the present strategy would work, thanks to some miracle or luck - suggest that Plan A ought to be exhausted before advancing towards Plan N. Wasting another 6 to 12 months could mean the risk of transforming a U-shaped recession into an L-shaped one, close to the Depression, but at present, Plan N is still not politically feasible.\" And this without taking into account that still in the case of nationalization, the state would assume all the garbage debt, that sooner rather than later will have to be declared a loss, that is, it will have to face debt restructuring in order to repair capitalist accumulation. And the fact that this is necessary not only in the banking and financial sector, but also in other parts of the economy, that is, big corporations, the housing mortgage sector, and the commercial sector, and households themselves, that have excessive debt, compared to their income. More precisely, debt service compared to income is the highest since the Great Depression. Up to now, corporations\\' costs and household consumption were being reduced, in order to cover debts. But until now, there has not been much restructuring: that is why it is likely that 2009 and 2010 will be years of bankruptcies and restructuring, which will be enormously painful and will test the political system.</p> \\n\\n<p>In this context, it is becoming ever more clear that the financial aristocracy that represents the dominant power in the US, to which the leaderships of the Democratic and Republican parties answer, appears as an insuperable obstacle for a solution to the crisis - with its amassing of capital, that exacerbates the rationing of credit and the spiraling fall of the \"real economy,\" confident that it can eventually force the government to absorb the total costs of its own losses - risking entering the Second Depression, if we have not already entered it. The extreme rise in unemployment, the contraction in world commerce, that is declining much more rapidly than at any moment of the Great Depression, and the collapse in industrial production, would appear to confirm it. Or on the financial terrain, the rise in the yield of ten-year US Treasury bonds, that has grown from 2% to 3% since Christmas, in spite of the enormous efforts to lower the rates. That is, what one has to pay to get a loan of certain sums of money is growing, in spite of the fact that the fall of the economy is increasing, which in economic terms is called debt deflation.</p> \\n\\n<p>This dark outlook, that could trigger popular dissatisfaction, now strongly contained by the illusions that Obama\\'s victory awakened, could be ominous for the entire US economic system, that could wear out this containment valve earlier than expected, in order to save itself and in accordance with the interests of its highest groups.</p> \\n\\n<p>[1] Zombie banks continue operating, but have already really gone bankrupt, or in the best case, have sufficient capital to stay afloat, but do not do anything that a bank allegedly should do, that is, lend to firms and households.</p>',\n",

She regularly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ava/status/817091193414684672\" type=\"external\">speaks out</a> on issues of social justice on her Twitter account, and two interviews published this week are reminders of DuVernay&#8217;s activist views.</p> \\n\\n<p>DuVernay hopes her art will have a political effect on audiences. &#8220;The ideas that Trump is talking about are deeply embedded in the documentary,&#8221; she <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/q-and-a/a51993/ava-duvernay-interview-13th/\" type=\"external\">told Esquire</a> in an interview published Tuesday.</p> \\n\\n<p>She continued:</p> \\n\\n<p>I hope, among many other things, people walk away from &#8220;13th&#8221; with a recognition of the pattern, the cycle, and the fact we&#8217;re in another one. It can feel like we&#8217;re in a moment that is completely new and never experienced before, unless we look to the past and understand the context within which we&#8217;re currently living, the context by which we find ourselves with a President Trump&#8212;which is hard for me to even say at this point. It&#8217;s wildly important, and it&#8217;s not done hardly enough, that we look back&#8212;and not just tip our hats, but really look back and understand, dig into it, unfold the layers of history so that we can live more deeply in the present.</p> \\n\\n<p>DuVernay does not shy away from speaking up about political injustice, even if it doesn&#8217;t always pertain to her filmmaking. In <a href=\"http://variety.com/2017/film/in-contention/playback-podcast-ava-duvernay-13th-1201952905/\" type=\"external\">an interview with Variety</a> published Thursday, DuVernay was candid about her feelings toward Trump&#8217;s upcoming inauguration.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;The power of the image is one that we all know as people who know film and practice film,&#8221; DuVernay said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a striking, emotional thing. And when he lifts his hand, puts his hand on that Bible and takes the oath, when we see the image, I pray that that is the thing that shakes us out of the stupor. Because then it&#8217;s done. I&#8217;m dreading the image. But it&#8217;s coming. It is real.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>DuVernay included material about Trump in &#8220;13th&#8221; and this clip from the documentary went viral late last year:</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;In the good ol&#8217; days&#8230;&#8221; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/13TH?src=hash\" type=\"external\">#13TH</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/2IzF87ODP6\" type=\"external\">pic.twitter.com/2IzF87ODP6</a></p> \\n\\n<p>&#8212; 13TH (@13THFilm) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/13THFilm/status/786295040314253312\" type=\"external\">October 12, 2016</a></p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Take him out? Leave him in? No, he doesn&#8217;t deserve a place in this thing,&#8221; DuVernay <a href=\"http://www.indiewire.com/2016/10/13th-clip-donald-trump-ava-duvernay-documentary-netflix-1201736323/\" type=\"external\">said of Trump</a> at a screening of the documentary last year. &#8220;But you gotta show that stuff because it&#8217;s too important and it can&#8217;t be forgotten. I think it&#8217;s vital to have him in there, because he&#8217;s taken this country to a place that is going to be studied and considered for a long time.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s addressed his views about it. He&#8217;s addressed a lack of empathy for imprisoned and incarcerated people,&#8221; DuVernay said at another screening in Los Angeles <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/film/in-contention/ava-duvernay-donald-trump-13th-mass-incarceration-1201917174/\" type=\"external\">shortly after the election</a>. &#8220;He&#8217;s talked about the industry around it. He&#8217;s &#8216;very good at business,&#8217; and he feels that it&#8217;s a business. Stocks for the private prison industry rose by over 50 percent the day after his election. So folks are betting on the fact that he will not just continue but increase that part of the business.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>But as the reality of a Trump administration has sunk in, DuVernay refuses to sink into despair. Instead, she has expressed hope about increasing activism and unity among those who oppose many of Trump&#8217;s values.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;These are dark times for a lot of people who believe differently than our incoming administration, but there&#8217;s also joy there, and there&#8217;s also something in unifying around the things that we do believe in,&#8221; she <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2016/12/ava-duvernay-13th-netflix-donald-trump-queen-sugar-a-wrinkle-in-time-1201873360/\" type=\"external\">told Deadline</a> at the end of 2016.</p> \\n\\n<p>She expanded on the sentiment in this week&#8217;s interview with Esquire. &#8220;I think there&#8217;s a good base of knowledge of what we&#8217;re opposing, but I think there&#8217;s going to be all kinds of new surprises, and I think people who are maybe apathetic to everything now will find themselves feeling agitated by what will happen,&#8221; DuVernay said.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;I automatically know what I&#8217;m opposing because the president[-elect] opposes my very existence and everything I stand for, so right there that&#8217;s a really clear response,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;But I think that there are folks who feel like they are usually on the inside of it, or have the privilege of not focusing on these things, who will be affected.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>This week isn&#8217;t the first time DuVernay has been outspoken about important issues&#8212;she has long addressed injustices within the film industry, as well as problems afflicting the nation as a whole.</p> \\n\\n<p>In 2015, as &#8220;Selma&#8221; was beginning to receive critical acclaim, DuVernay used her newfound success to discuss race and gender in interviews with popular entertainment outlets.</p> \\n\\n<p>For example, she <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ava-duvernay-advocating-female-directors-840942\" type=\"external\">told The Hollywood Reporter</a> in November 2015 that her biggest frustration with Hollywood was &#8220;[t]hat only 4 percent of studio directors are women.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Around the same time, she explained how the shooting in Ferguson and the Black Lives Matter movement actively influenced her work. &#8220;Michael Brown was murdered while I was in the editing room for &#8216;Selma&#8217;, so watching [the news] and watching all the coverage in Ferguson influenced the way I was cutting,&#8221; she <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/director-ava-duvernay-talks-race-hollywood-doing-it-her-way-n439676\" type=\"external\">told NBC News</a>.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;For there only to be one dominant voice determining what&#8217;s said and saying it is something that all like-minded people who believe in dignity of everyone should be concerned about. That comes into play for women and for people of color,&#8221; she said in her interview with The Hollywood Reporter. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a problem that can be fixed by the word &#8216;diversity,&#8217; whatever that means. It&#8217;s a problem that&#8217;s going to take a multipronged solution and allies all over the place who say, &#8216;We want to make a change.&#8217;&amp;#160;&#8220;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Any film that you see that has any progressive spirits that is made by any people of color or a woman is a triumph, in and of itself,&#8221; she said in her NBC News interview, noting that the statistics &#8220;are dismal when it comes to women filmmakers, even worse, horrible, horrific when it comes to women-of-color filmmakers.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>DuVernay&#8217;s current and future work also reflect her progressive ideals. She currently is directing a <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-ava-duvernay-wrinkle-in-time-20161102-story.html\" type=\"external\">film version</a> of the award-winning science fantasy classic <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/04/12/the-storyteller-cynthia-zarin\" type=\"external\">&#8220;A Wrinkle in Time&#8221;</a> and is the creator and executive producer of the television show <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Sugar\" type=\"external\">&#8220;Queen Sugar.&#8221;</a></p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;If have the opportunity to do a television show, I want to make something like &#8216;Queen Sugar&#8217; where it&#8217;s a family drama that chronicles the current Black Lives Matter moment and what that means, and have a formerly incarcerated main character,&#8221; she told Esquire. &#8220;If I&#8217;m doing a Disney movie, I want to do a film that has something to say, a film that is a cross between social commentary and spirituality and science, and that&#8217;s &#8216;A Wrinkle in Time.&#8217; I just approach it all from a place of my own interests and exercising my voice.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>At a time when many Americans are using movies as <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2016/12/movie-history-first-year-may-end-without-real-world-box-office-top-10-1201867045/\" type=\"external\">relief from political chaos</a>, DuVernay is staunchly refusing to make comfortably entertaining films. She allows contemporary politics to influence her work, and she in turn affects the country with her art.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;13th&#8221; already has won <a href=\"http://www.avaduvernay.com/#/13th/\" type=\"external\">numerous awards</a>, has been nominated for <a href=\"http://hollywoodsblackrenaissance.com/humanitas-prize-finalists/\" type=\"external\">The Humanitas Prize</a> and is <a href=\"http://www.indiewire.com/2016/12/oscars-2017-best-documentary-shortlist-oj-made-in-america-cameraperson-1201752693/\" type=\"external\">generating Oscar buzz</a>.</p> \\n\\n<p>DuVernay&#8217;s two interviews this week prove she isn&#8217;t done fighting for justice, despite the success of &#8220;13th&#8221; and her growing Hollywood career. She continues to encourage her fans to engage in political activism and fight against regressive politics.</p> \\n\\n<p>For her work breaking down barriers and shining a light on injustice both inside and outside the film industry, Ava DuVernay is our Truthdigger of the Week.</p>',\n",

The piece focused on Ohio&#8217;s poor national ranking for private-sector job growth from March 2002 to March 2012. George W. Bush was president for nearly seven of those years. And the time period includes a significant overall decline in the number of Ohio&#8217;s private-sector jobs, which <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/sae/\" type=\"external\">peaked</a> in June 2000.</p> \\n\\n<p>The truth is Ohio&#8217;s job growth under Obama ranks higher than most states.</p> \\n\\n<p>American City Business Journals, which includes the Dayton publication, <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/on-numbers/scott-thomas/2012/05/seven-states-add-more-than-100000.html\" type=\"external\">used</a> numbers from the <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/\" type=\"external\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> to rank all 50 states and the District of Columbia based on private-sector job growth over 10 years. Ohio came in 50th (out of 51) &#8212; both for the number of jobs it lost (285,000) and for the percentage decrease (-6 percent).</p> \\n\\n<p>But under Obama, Ohio <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">ranks fourth</a> for the net number of private-sector jobs gained &#8212; nearly 200,000 &#8211; between February 2009, the president&#8217;s first full month in office, and July of this year. The state <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">comes in</a> 17th based on the percentage increase, which is 4.6 percent.</p> \\n\\n<p>Even accounting for the loss of more than 30,000 government jobs, Ohio still <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">ranks</a> 17th under Obama based on the total number of seasonally adjusted, non-farm jobs that it gained, which is 9,300. The state <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">ranks</a> 21st based on percentage change, which is less than 1 percent.</p> \\n\\n<p>Ohio also had a high ranking in a Rutgers University <a href=\"http://policy.rutgers.edu/reports/rrr/RRRjuly12.pdf\" type=\"external\">study</a> that charted private-sector job gains in each state during and after the most recent recession. Ohio came in sixth for absolute jobs gained and 22nd based on the percentage at which it recovered jobs since December 2009, when the number of private-sector jobs bottomed out.</p> \\n\\n<p>Granted, Ohio still has more than 400,000 fewer private-sector jobs than it did at its peak of 4.9 million in June 2000. And it continues to be among the top states for government jobs losses under Obama, according to the Rutgers <a href=\"http://policy.rutgers.edu/reports/rrr/RRRjuly12.pdf\" type=\"external\">study</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/Documents/magazine/articles/2012/SL-0712-Stats.pdf\" type=\"external\">National Conference of State Legislatures</a>.</p> \\n\\n<p>And jobs numbers have plummeted in other states. For example, Florida lost 45,000 private-sector jobs between February 2009 and July.</p> \\n\\n<p>But Ohio is a far cry from being &#8220;the second-worst&#8221; for job losses under Obama as ATR claims. Plus, the country <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/ces/\" type=\"external\">has experienced</a> a net gain of more than 1 million private-sector jobs and more than 350,000 total non-farm jobs&amp;#160;between February 2009 and July.</p> \\n\\n<p>More Slippery Statistics</p> \\n\\n<p>ATR claims that &#8220;over 88,000 Ohio workers have lost their jobs&#8221; since Obama took office. But that number includes 25,000 jobs that disappeared before he took the oath. And ATR bases that job-loss figure on a BLS survey that economists typically do not use as the standard measure for jobs.</p> \\n\\n<p>As&amp;#160;we&#8217;ve <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">explained</a> before, the Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.tn.htm\" type=\"external\">produces</a> its job figures from two major monthly surveys taken the week that contains the 12th day. Obama&#8217;s inauguration was Jan. 20, 2009.</p> \\n\\n<p>ATR bases its job-loss claim on numbers from the monthly Current Population Survey, which polls a sample of households, classifying people over the age of 16 as employed or unemployed.&amp;#160;The survey <a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LASST39000005?data_tool=XGtable\" type=\"external\">showed</a> that 5,440,551 Ohioans held jobs on Jan. 12, 2009, compared with 5,352,679 in July of this year &#8212; a difference of nearly 88,000. But if you count from February &#8212; Obama&#8217;s first full month in office &#8212; the difference falls to a little more than 62,000.</p> \\n\\n<p>Furthermore, Ohio has gained jobs under Obama based on the other major survey. The Current Employment Statistics survey&amp;#160;is the standard measure for jobs used by economists and journalists. It collects information from businesses and government agencies and provides seasonally adjusted figures of employees on non-farm payrolls. The survey, which we referred to above, shows that Ohio has added 9,300 jobs since February 2009.</p> \\n\\n<p>The mailer also claims that &#8220;with all of the spending and waste, Ohio&#8217;s unemployment has reached as high as 10.6 percent.&#8221; The state&#8217;s unemployment rate was indeed <a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LASST39000003\" type=\"external\">10.6 percent</a> &#8212; above the national rate&#8217;s&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000\" type=\"external\">peak</a> of 10 percent &#8212; for seven straight months between July 2009 and January 2010.</p> \\n\\n<p>But ATR fails to mention that Ohio&#8217;s unemployment rate has fallen well below the national average since then. It was&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LASST39000003\" type=\"external\">7.2 percent</a> in July &#8212; almost 1 percentage point lower than the national rate of <a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000\" type=\"external\">8.1 percent</a>.</p> \\n\\n<p>The mailer asks: &#8220;Now the [stimulus] money is gone. But where are the jobs?&#8221; As we&#8217;ve <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">written</a> before, the Congressional Budget Office <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/02-22-ARRA.pdf\" type=\"external\">has found</a> that the 2009 stimulus positively affected the economy, making its strongest impact during the third quarter of 2010. Nationally, the unemployment rate was between 0.4 percentage points and 2 percentage points lower than it would have been without the stimulus, CBO said. The number of people employed was higher by between 700,000 and 3.6 million.</p> \\n\\n<p><a href=\"\" type=\"internal\" /></p> \\n\\n<p>Flimsy Fraud Claim</p> \\n\\n<p>The flyer also spins a quote from a 2009 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/18/us/18fraud.html\" type=\"external\">New York Times article</a> about the&amp;#160;potential mishandling of stimulus money.</p> \\n\\n<p>ATR Mailer: Obama officials admitted: $55 billion of stimulus cash may have been lost through waste, fraud and abuse.</p> \\n\\n<p>Obama officials admitted to no such thing.

It turns out quite a lot.</p> \\n\\n<p>Antonin Baudry was young, smart and ambitious when he was hired in 2002 to write speeches for then-Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin.</p> \\n\\n<p>These were heady days, just months after 9/11, and France was being pressured by the US government to support George W. Bush and his plans to attack Iraq. While it may not exactly sound like a romp, Antonin Baudry turns his government experience into a French farce-meets-The Office in a funny graphic novel called \" <a href=\"http://issuu.com/selfmadehero/docs/weapons_of_mass_diplomacy_issuu?e=0/7175273\" type=\"external\">Quai d\\'Orsay</a>.\" It will be released in English in the United States in April under the title \"Weapons of Mass Diplomacy\".&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>Baudry, who is now the French cultural counselor in the United States, originally wrote Quai d\\'Orsay using the pen name, Abel Lanzac. Baudry insists he wasn\\'t trying to hide. &amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>\"It was a pen name, which is very common in France,\" he says. \"A lot of writers have pen names. I used a pen name because I really wanted to separate my daily activities from my writing and I also wanted to have the freedom to say whatever I wanted.\"</p> \\n\\n<p>The graphic novel was a success in France and has now been turned into a film. It\\'s a comedy and has just been released in the US under the title, \"The French Minister,\" directed by Bernard Tavernier. Baudry says his book and film are not about revealing secrets.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"It\\'s really a way to show how the staff of the French foreign ministry actually functioned during a tense time and how the foreign minister went about making difficult decisions.\" Baudry says the whole experience somehow lent itself to satire.&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>In the graphic novel and the film, the French foreign ministry comes across as chaotic, capricious and disorganized, with huge egos and odd personalities.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"It\\'s very common that, in any organization, that when there are a lot of emergencies at the same time, there is a kind of frantic atmosphere,\" says Baudry. \"Somehow, there is a kind of hysteria, but it\\'s also true that there are very dedicated, serious, smart people trying to do their job.\"</p> \\n\\n<p>Baudry hopes that the graphic novel and film show how that chaotic process can actually produce good decisions. &amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>He says his background was as a writer, so when he was hired to worked (in real life) for Dominique de Villepin, he knew little about the world of diplomacy.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"I was surprised, basically, by everything,\" he says. \"I was surprised by the grandeur, the magnificent buildings and palaces that contrasted with the very small offices where everyone was working.\"</p> \\n\\n<p>He was also surpised by the dedication of the staff. \"People were there day and night, 24/7, working, working, working. They were trying to solve crises, trying to find correct answers to many, many problems.\"</p> \\n\\n<p>Baudry says some of the civil servants he worked with left lasting impressions on him. \"They were really, for me, models. They sacrificed their private life for the common good.\"</p> \\n\\n<p>Alexandre Taillard de Worms, the fictional French foreign minister in Baudry\\'s graphic novel, shares many traits with the one he worked for, Dominique de Villepin.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"He has a strong vision of what he believes must be done,\" Baudry says. \"He\\'s always moving, always speaking and never takes the time to stop and try to figure out abstractions.\"</p> \\n\\n<p>And in real life, those traits served Baudry\\'s boss, De Villepin, well.</p> \\n\\n<p>De Villepin famously opposed the US plan to attack Iraq after 9/11.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"He&amp;#160;was really convinced,\" says Baudry. \"And when he made his famous speech at the United Nations, everyone in France was watching it. And it really changed the perception in France. People said, \\'Yes, he\\'s right about that.\\'\" When asked if he helped write that speech, Baudry says he only helped &#8212; that it was&amp;#160;de Villepin\\'s vision and ideas.</p>',\n",

Vogel&#8217;s research looks at media treatment of gender-based violence, <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2018/01/10/don-t-erase-stories-abuse-vague-headlines/219027\" type=\"external\">including how headlines about assault are written</a>. Some of the articles that mention Milano as the founder of the #MeToo&amp;#160;campaign include an editor&#8217;s note&amp;#160;about Burke, but Vogel says that the headlines can undo that nuance.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;So much important reporting work can be undone without a well-thought-out headline,&#8221; she said.</p> \\n\\n<p>The biggest name in #MeToo stories is still Harvey Weinstein. <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/10/27/weinstein-scandal-complete-list-accusers/804663001/\" type=\"external\">Eighty-four women</a> have accused Weinstein of sexual harassment and assault, and he is mentioned in nearly 6,000 stories in the US. Weinstein&#8217;s story is also a focus internationally. Thus far, over 15,000 articles have included his name.</p> \\n\\n<p>Accusers also receive far more media attention than their victims &#8212; combined.</p> \\n\\n<p>Former Minnesota Sen. Al Franken, who was accused by seven women of harassment (including four who remain unnamed) has been a frequent figure in the press. He was nearly seven times likelier to be mentioned in relation to #MeToo than his accusers.</p> \\n\\n<p>Louis C.K., <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/arts/television/louis-ck-sexual-misconduct.html\" type=\"external\">who was accused by five women</a> of sexual misconduct, was referenced in the US media nearly 500 times. The names of the women bringing forward allegations against him surface in fewer than 10 articles.</p> \\n\\n<p>The #MeToo hashtag was most popular after Milano&#8217;s first tweet &#8212; but since then has remained a part of the Twitter conversation, with additional surges of popularity tied to breaking news events.</p> \\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s also a global phenomenon. International versions of #MeToo have also gained traction, particularly the French #BalanceTonPorc&#8221; (&#8220;Call out your pig&#8221;), which is the most popular translated hashtag.</p> \\n\\n<p>But international coverage of #MeToo in the US tends to focus only on the West.</p> \\n\\n<p>That&#8217;s particularly the case for critics of #MeToo. French actress Catherine Deneuve, who wrote <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">an open letter against the #MeToo movement</a>, was written about more in the US than in France. Although there are more stories written in the US, overall (about twice as much volume than in the French national media), Deneuve was mentioned nearly three times more often.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;When #MeToo hit, it was amazing,&#8221; said Bernice Yeung, a reporter for Reveal News. &#8220;We had been covering this issue for years, and it was great to see the spotlight, the groundswell on this issue.&#8221; But Yeung, who covers issues of sexual assault and harassment among low-wage workers, points out that <a href=\"https://www.revealnews.org/blog/the-people-metoo-leaves-behind/\" type=\"external\">there are many women who are not named at all in the media.</a></p> \\n\\n<p>The bias in media coverage towards celebrities and political figures is unsurprising to Yeung.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;As members of the press, we do gravitate towards people who are brand names or well-known. They lend a level of credibility and familiarity to a topic,&#8221; she said.</p> \\n\\n<p>Still, Yeung is optimistic that those who can afford to say #MeToo publicly can help open up the conversation to all women, citing the <a href=\"https://www.timesupnow.com/\" type=\"external\">Time&#8217;s Up</a> legal defense fund, which makes diversity and inclusion a priority. In terms of the media, Yeung sees an opportunity for more inclusive reporting.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;I think there are just voices we should hear more from,&#8221; Yeung said. &#8220;The majority of us are not in media or Hollywood&amp;#160;or politics.&#8221;</p>',\n",

              " 7223: '<p>For 23 years, the AFL-CIO has been issuing a report on workplace neglect leading to job-related deaths. According to the <a href=\"http://www.aflcio.org/content/download/126621/3464561/DOTJ2014.pdf\" type=\"external\">2014 edition of this report</a>, which is based on data from 2012, North Dakota has the highest worker mortality rate per capita at 17.7 per 100,000 workers. This is the highest rate ever recorded for the state. Other states with high death rates included Wyoming with 12.2, Alaska with 8.9, Montana with 7.3, and West Virginia with 6.9.</p> \\n\\n<p>Overall, in 2012, 4,628 workers were killed due to traumatic injuries suffered in the workplace. However, this number does not account for death due to chronic work-related illnesses. For example, exposure to toxic chemicals in the workplace can go for years without resulting in any symptoms. AFL-CIO estimates that these work-related deaths amount to another 50,000 annually.</p> \\n\\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.krdo.com/news/economy-tracker/20-deadliest-states-for-workers/25878364\" type=\"external\">KRDO</a>, an estimated 12 workers die every day as a result of workplace injuries. AFL-CIO aims to reduce this number by increasing awareness of the risks, pushing regulatory measures, and securing employer participation in worker safety.</p> \\n\\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.aflcio.org/Issues/Job-Safety/Death-on-the-Job-Report\" type=\"external\">press release</a> from AFL-CIO notes that the passage of Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) in 1970 was the first major measure for workplace safety. Since then, the job fatality rate has been cut by 81 percent, saving more than 492,000 lives. However, the organization comments that there is still more work to be done. With a number of states seeing increases in their job fatality rate, there is clearly room for improvement.</p> \\n\\n<p />',\n",
              " 7225: '<p>The title of this session asks if we&#8217;ve run out of economic policies. This is a silly question, as can be shown with some clearer thinking on the economy. Debates on economic policy too often get reduced to narrow debates on tax and transfer policy. While tax and transfer policy is hugely important, this focus absurdly narrows the scope for economic policy. This narrowing is especially unfortunate in a country like France, where the use of the euro has sharply limited its ability to run budget deficits, or stimulate its economy through monetary or exchange rate policy. This means that its ability to do much at this point through tax and transfer policy is seriously constrained.</p> \\n\\n<p>Nonetheless there are many areas in which the French government could implement policies that would both boost growth and reduce unemployment and inequality. In my book, Rigged: How Globalization and the Rules of the Modern Economy Were Structured to Make the Rich Richer, I discuss five areas in which the market has been structured in ways that redistribute income upward.[1]&amp;#160;I should caution that this book was written with the U.S. economy as the primary point of reference, however most of the points would apply to France as well, even if the upward redistribution in France has not been anywhere near as large as in the United States.</p> \\n\\n<p>1) Macroeconomic policy. Fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policy largely determine the level of employment and unemployment. Institutional factors, like rules on overtime and vacation policy, can also affect employment levels by affecting the supply of labor.</p> \\n\\n<p>2) Regulation of the financial sector. The financial sector enjoys a privileged position almost everywhere, being exempt from much taxation and relying on the government as a lender of last resort.</p> \\n\\n<p>3) Corporate governance. In the United States, the process of corporate governance has become increasingly corrupted so that it is very difficult for shareholders to put a check on the pay of CEOs and other top managers. Top management has a large voice in selecting the directors who oversee them. Once selected, directors have little incentive to challenge CEO pay, since virtually all slated directors are re-elected. The result is CEO salaries that often reach into the tens of millions annually.</p> \\n\\n<p>4) Protected professionals. In the United States, the most highly paid professionals, doctors and dentists in particular, are largely protected from both foreign and domestic competition. As a result, their pay is more than twice the average for other wealthy countries.</p> \\n\\n<p>5) Intellectual property. Patent and copyright monopolies often raise the price of protected items by several thousand percent above the free market price. This is especially important in the case of prescription drugs where patent monopolies can make drugs that would be cheap in a free market extremely expensive. These protections not only threaten health care, they also are a big part of the story of upward redistribution.</p> \\n\\n<p>I will focus my remarks on intellectual property since there is so much at stake and the issues involved are poorly understood.</p> \\n\\n<p>The United States will spend more than $440 billion on drugs in 2017 that would sell in a free market, without patents or related protections, for less than $80 billion. The difference of more than $360 billion is almost 2 percent of GDP, or almost one-third of after-tax corporate profits. (The markups on drugs will be less in France, where prices are regulated.) There are also huge markups, typically in the range of 1000 percent or more, in medical equipment, pesticides, fertilizers, seed crops, software, recorded music and video material, and books.</p> \\n\\n<p>In total, the gap between Intellectual Property (IP) protected prices and free market prices in the United States is likely to be more than 5 percent of GDP, or over $900 billion in the U.S. economy. This is a massive transfer of income from the bulk of the population to the people who are in a situation to benefit from IP protection. The beneficiaries are not only the shareholders of pharmaceutical companies, software makers, and other companies that directly benefit from these protections but also the highly skilled segment of the workforce, such as biochemists and software engineers, who see an increase in the demand for their skills as a result of these protections.</p> \\n\\n<p>This point is important for two reasons. First, it is far from obvious that patents and copyrights are the best mechanisms for supporting innovation and creative work in the 21 st century. These are relics of the medieval guild system that have managed to survive through a combination of inertia and special interest lobbying.</p> \\n\\n<p>The gap between the IP-protected price and the free market price leads to the same sort of economic waste and corruption that is the predicted result of trade tariffs. But in this case, instead of being 20 or 30 percent, the protection is equivalent to tariffs of 1000 percent or more. Most obviously, this means that many people who could afford drugs, medical equipment, or other items at the free market price, but not at the protected price, are denied access. This is a huge issue in the developing world, but even in the rich countries, there are many people who go without needed medicine because IP protection makes it too costly.</p> \\n\\n<p>To take a dramatic example, the Hepatitis C drug Sovaldi carries a list price in the United States of $84,000 for a three-month course of treatment. High-quality generic versions are available in India for less than $300.&amp;#160;[2]&amp;#160;Many of the new cancer drugs carry list prices in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. In almost all cases these drugs are cheap to produce; it is the patent monopoly that makes them expensive.</p> \\n\\n<p>But this is just the beginning of the problems with patent protection in the case of prescription drugs. The huge markups encourage drug companies to push their drugs for conditions where it is not appropriate. There are many instances where they have made payoffs to doctors to promote their drugs in talks or articles for medical journals. They also misrepresent research findings, concealing evidence that their drugs may not be as effective as claimed or even harmful in some circumstances.</p> \\n\\n<p>Patent protection also encourages secrecy in research, as companies want to maximize their own ability to profit rather than giving away information to potential competitors. And it leads to unnecessary duplicative research, as drug companies may seek to innovate around the patent of a major breakthrough drug in order to get a portion of the patent rents. While the increased competition may be desirable in a world of patent monopolies, if drugs were selling at their free market price it is unlikely that we would devote large amounts of resources to developing the second, third, and fourth drugs for a condition that can already be treated, as opposed to spending the money to develop a drug for a condition for which no treatment exists.&amp;#160;[3]</p> \\n\\n<p>There are alternative mechanisms to patent financing for prescription drug research, most obviously direct government funding. The United States is already spending more than $30 billion annually through the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This compares to around $50 billion that the pharmaceutical industry claims to spend on research each year. The NIH funding is overwhelming focused on basic research, but there are instances where it has actually funded the development of drugs and paid for clinical trials.</p> \\n\\n<p>There is no reason why public funding could not be expanded and focused on the later phases of research and clinical testing. The new drugs could then be sold at generic prices since the research has already been paid for. An alternative route is to establish a prize system under which patents for important drugs are purchased by the government and placed in the public domain so that they could then be sold as generics.</p> \\n\\n<p>Under both these systems, the research findings and clinical test results could be made completely public. This would be a huge benefit to doctors, who would be able to make more informed decisions in prescribing drugs. Some drugs may be more effective for some groups of people than others, or have bad side effects when mixed with other drugs. Full disclosure of test results would make this information available to doctors.</p> \\n\\n<p>The case of prescription drugs is worth highlighting because it is probably the most egregious example of the waste and corruption of the current IP system, but there are many other instances that could be cited. In the tech industry, for years Apple and Samsung were competing as much in the court system over competing patent claims as in the market for smartphones. Patent trolling, buying up rights to a patent and hoping to be able to get a suit against a major company into court, is a major form of livelihood for many lawyers.</p> \\n\\n<p>In the case of copyright, the United States has made the monopolies ever longer (now 95 years) and the penalties for infringements ever greater. Here too there are alternatives. The U.S. system of a tax deduction for charitable contributions presents an obvious model. A tax credit could be allowed for contributions to support creative work, with the condition of receiving the money that the work is in the public domain.</p> \\n\\n<p>The relative merits of alternatives to IP for supporting innovation and creative work can be debated. I mention these to point out that the IP system is a policy option and is not the only known mechanism for these purposes.</p> \\n\\n<p>However, there is an even more basic point that must be recognized. The strength and length of IP rules are things directly determined by public policy in large part. There has been a conscious decision in the rich countries to make these rules stronger in the last four decades. This has benefited highly skilled workers and IP related industries at the expense of everyone else. In principle, there should be a payoff to society from stronger IP rules in the form of more rapid productivity growth. This is a very questionable proposition, especially given the extremely weak productivity growth we have seen over the last decade.</p> \\n\\n<p>However, even if there were a dividend from stronger IP protection in the form of more rapid productivity growth, this should still be an explicit topic for public debate. In other words, we should be asking how much upward redistribution we are willing to tolerate in exchange for a predicted gain in productivity growth.</p> \\n\\n<p>This debate has not taken place in the United States, France, or to my knowledge any other country in the world. The bottom line here is that it is clearly not true that it is just technology making some people very wealthy and making many others less well off. This outcome is the result of clear policy choices that unfortunately have been largely left out of public debate.</p> \\n\\n<p>Notes.</p> \\n\\n<p>[1]&amp;#160;See&amp;#160; <a href=\"https://deanbaker.net/books/rigged.htm\" type=\"external\">https://deanbaker.net/books/rigged.htm</a>.</p> \\n\\n<p>[2]&amp;#160;See&amp;#160; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">http://www.thebodypro.com/content/78658/1000-fold-mark-up-for-drug-prices-in-high-income-c.html</a>.</p> \\n\\n<p>[3]&amp;#160;Having multiple drugs for a condition is desirable, since patients will respond differently to the same drug, but the question is the amount of resources that should be devoted to duplicative drugs.</p> \\n\\n<p>Remarks by Dean Baker, Co-Director, Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR), at&amp;#160;Les Rencontres &#201;conomiques d&#8217;Aix-en-Provence.</p> \\n\\n<p>&amp;#160;</p>',\n",

Such prominent believers include Francis Collins, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, and popular biology textbook author Keith Miller, both of whom have widely witnessed to the enriching of their Christian faith through their scientific discipline.</p> \\n\\n<p>Most troublingly, the movie portrays the Holocaust as the direct result of evolutionary science &#8212; what some religious figures have egregiously styled &#8220;No Darwin, no Hitler.&#8221; Its unbounded conspiracy paranoia paints a distorted view of the practice of science as untrustworthy and destructive. Yet this is the very time we need to encourage students to pursue scientific careers to help address a wide range of global concerns about energy, environment, medical care, food and resource use.</p> \\n\\n<p>To reject the process and products of our God-given intellect applied through scientific investigation is theologically unnecessary and pragmatically damaging.</p> \\n\\n<p>We should take to heart Augustine's warning: &#8220;Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking nonsense on [scientific] topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn. The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>As a contemporary commentator (Charles Krauthammer) has observed, &#8220;The relentless attempt to confuse [science and religion] by teaching warmed-over creationism as science can only bring ridicule to religion, gratuitously discrediting a great human endeavor and our deepest source of wisdom precisely about those questions &#8212; arguably, the most important questions in life &#8212; that lie beyond the material.

First, they&#8217;re going on a &#8220;fact-finding mission&#8221; in one last effort to resolve the negotiations. But if they do decide to walk out of their classrooms, it will be the second time the union&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;which has 27,000 members and serves the nation&#8217;s third largest school district in the nation&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;has gone on strike in just a few years.</p> \\n\\n<p>How did the CTU and mayor&#8217;s office get here? It&#8217;s complicated.</p> \\n\\n<p>Back in 2012, there was a massive <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/11/education/teacher-strike-begins-in-chicago-amid-signs-that-deal-isnt-close.html\" type=\"external\">teachers strike</a> over maintaining the schedule for career advancement, putting less emphasis on standardized testing in teacher evaluations, and providing compensation for longer school years. It was the first time that Chicago teachers had gone on strike in a quarter of a century.</p> \\n\\n<p>During the strike, which began on September 10 of that year, CPS opened sites at libraries, churches, and nonprofits to provide children a place to go. One week later, Mayor Rahm Emanuel <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/18/education/chicago-teachers-strike-enters-second-week.html\" type=\"external\">went to court</a>, seeking a preliminary injunction to stop the strike.</p> \\n\\n<p>The 2012 strike officially ended on September 18, after the teachers union won annual raises and negotiated a provision that helps strongly rated laid-off teachers find more job opportunities in Chicago schools. They conceded, though, that standardized test results would still be factored into teachers&#8217; evaluations.</p> \\n\\n<p>This time around, many of the same issues are at play in contract negotiations. The CTU wants to reduce standardized testing, give teachers more autonomy on issues like grades and smaller class sizes, and provide for more school nurses and librarians. The union <a href=\"http://www.ctunet.com/blog/ctu-strike-authorization-96-5-percent-yes\" type=\"external\">also asks</a> that the school address larger economic problems by providing translation services, restorative justice programs, and school counselors.</p> \\n\\n<p>The relationship between the mayor and the CTU did not improve after reaching a deal in 2012. In fact, it became so contentious that the president of the teachers union, Karen Lewis, considered jumping into the mayor&#8217;s race herself. Though she ultimately decided <a href=\"http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/politics/karen-lewis-martin-luther-king-jr-breakfast-288703361.html\" type=\"external\">not to run</a> due to medical issues, education loomed large in the most recent mayoral race. Emanuel&#8217;s opponent, Jesus &#8220;Chuy&#8221; Garcia, was recruited by Lewis to run and received a substantial portion of his campaign money from teachers unions, <a href=\"http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20141212/BLOGS02/141219915/mayoral-challenger-garcia-gets-another-200k-nears-1-million\" type=\"external\">including</a> $200,000 from the American Federation of Teachers.</p> \\n\\n<p>After failing to win more than 50 percent of the vote in the primary, Emanuel had to run against Garcia in a run-off election, during which Emanuel won with 55 percent of the vote.</p> \\n\\n<p>Although Emanuel was able to carry every majority black ward in the city the last time he was elected, winning 58 percent of the vote in six wards that were majority black, the support from the same wards this year ranged from 42 to 45 percent, <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-chicago-mayor-emanuel-garcia-voting-met-0226-20150225-story.html\" type=\"external\">according to</a> the Chicago Tribune. The change in support from black voters may have been tied to the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/14/cps-school-closing-list-r_n_2685978.html\" type=\"external\">closure of schools</a> in predominantly black neighborhoods, a practice that many education equity advocates called racist and classist, as well as a lack of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/chicago-mayors-race-is-dividing-the-citys-black-community/2015/03/13/bb10be44-c8c8-11e4-aa1a-86135599fb0f_story.html\" type=\"external\">response to violent crime</a>, according to political journalists and analysts.</p> \\n\\n<p>Anger over the city closing schools that primarily serve low-income black students has been brewing for some time&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;long before Emanuel took over the mayor&#8217;s office.</p> \\n\\n<p>The practice of shuttering low-performing schools, based on the idea that students would be better served in new schools, was pioneered during Arne Duncan&#8217;s leadership as CEO of Chicago Public Schools in the early 2000s. Duncan&#8217;s ambitions didn&#8217;t quite pan out. Many of the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mercedes-schneider/school-ironies-the-fizzle_b_6504252.html\" type=\"external\">new schools</a> replacing the low-performing schools <a href=\"http://www.wbez.org/news/history-school-closings-chicago-2002-12-104383\" type=\"external\">weren&#8217;t actually high-performing</a>.</p> \\n\\n<p>It got worse in 2013, when Chicago Public Schools <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/14/cps-school-closing-list-r_n_2685978.html\" type=\"external\">released</a> a list of 129 schools being considered for closure. &#8220;This city cannot destroy that many schools. It will send our district into chaos,&#8221; Lewis said in response. &#8220;These actions will put our students&#8217; safety and academics at risk and will further destabilize our neighborhoods.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>That anger over the school closures bubbled up again recently when a group of around 12 parents and community activists began a hunger strike to protest the closure of their neighborhood school, Dyett High School. Their hunger strike lasted for a month and gained national attention, which once again highlighted the political fallout from the 2013 school closures. After discussions with the mayor and CPS, the city eventually agreed to keep the school open.</p> \\n\\n<p>The current strike that&#8217;s brewing couldn&#8217;t come at a worse time for Emanuel, who is now being criticized for his <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">handling</a> of the death of a black male teenager, Laquan McDonald, who was shot 16 times by a white police officer. Emanuel released the video 13 months after the shooting&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;only after a judge forced its release&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;and initially fought a civil rights investigation into the case by the U.S. Department of Justice. As Emanuel visited the Urban Prep campus this week, students <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-emanuel-urban-prep-mcdonald-protest-met-20151216-story.html\" type=\"external\">protested</a> his visit by shouting &#8220;16 shots&#8221; at the mayor.</p> \\n\\n<p>All of these elements&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;anger over school closures, a history of tension between the mayor and president of the teachers union, and the shooting of Laquan McDonald&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;have contributed to the political powder keg in which a strike could take place. In conjunction with all of these concerns over racial and educational inequities, there&#8217;s also a major financial crisis within CPS.</p> \\n\\n<p>The Chicago Public School system is having a budget crisis and may need to lay off 5,000 teachers to fill a $480 million gap. As a result, CPS CEO Forrest Claypool has <a href=\"http://chicagotonight.wttw.com/2015/12/16/cps-ceo-forrest-claypool-talks-new-contract-proposal-budget-woes\" type=\"external\">asked teachers</a> to pay more into their pensions, effectively loaning $500 million from the Chicago Teachers Pension Fund, and said there will be deep central office cuts to prevent cuts affecting the classroom itself.</p> \\n\\n<p>Claypool said there would be raises in the third and fourth year of the contract to cover the costs of contributing to the pension, but CTU questioned whether the union could trust CPS after it <a href=\"http://wgntv.com/2015/12/15/cps-ceo-talks-budget-contract-proposal-union-fires-back/\" type=\"external\">rescinded</a> a fourth year raise in 2011 due to a budget deficit.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;The mayor&#8217;s hand-picked Board continues to force a no-win choice on educators: Accept deep cuts to our salaries and health benefits now or choose massive layoffs and larger class sizes in the weeks to come,&#8221; the union <a href=\"http://wgntv.com/2015/12/15/cps-ceo-talks-budget-contract-proposal-union-fires-back/\" type=\"external\">said in a statement</a> this week.</p>',\n",

Some <a href=\"http://boldprogressives.org/chicagos-teachers-just-went-on-strike-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-why/\" type=\"external\">union officials claim</a> Emanuel canceled a previously negotiated pay increase.

District officials said the teachers&#8217; average pay is $76,000 a year.</p> \\n\\n<p>When you see references to &#8220;evaluations,&#8221; you should know this is about tying teacher evaluations&#8211;and hence a teacher&#8217;s job&#8211;to student performance on tests. There is considerable <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">controversy</a> over the validity of various testing/evaluation schemes.</p> \\n\\n<p>And does that salary figure represent a teacher&#8217;s wages, or salary plus benefits like health care and retirement?

Why does Israel come here?&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Little is known of Babar&#8217;s babbles outside the confines of Hakirya, the &#8220;campus&#8221; of the Israeli high command, and of South Block, which houses the Indian External Affairs and Defense ministries. What he referred to are the growing military and security ties between India and Israel. As well, he might have referenced the now rather solid links between the Hindu Right and the Israeli Right, and how their view of the conflicts that run from Jerusalem to Srinagar mirror those of the jihadis like Babar. Imran Babar and his fellow terrorists come to their critique from the standard anti-Semitism, anti-Americanism that blinds many aggrieved jihadis. Rather than make a concrete assessment of their grievances, they take refuge in as mythical a world as sketched out by the Israeli Right-Hindu Right, where Jews, Hindus and America are arrayed against Muslims.</p> \\n\\n<p>That the terrorists attacked the Chabad-Lubavitch Center has renewed the call to see the commonalities between the victims of terrorism, whether those in a Haifa restaurant or a Mumbai train, between 9/11 and 11/26. To do so flattens out a significant differences, and reduces the violence to their acts themselves rather than to the social context that leads people to acts of terror. Mumbai provokes the Right to seek recourse to the solutions of war and surveillance, methods that might create a moment&#8217;s sense of security before the wily adversary finds a new technological means to strike back. There is no common technical solution: better sniper rifles or iris scanners, better intelligence databases or cattle prods. The weapons used to deal the fatal blow to the terrorists are also incubators of a new generation of terrorists. This is an elementary lesson, lost to those who seek the silver bullet.</p> \\n\\n<p>Why Does Israel Come Here?</p> \\n\\n<p>On September 10, 2008, Israel&#8217;s top army official, General Avi Mizrahi landed in New Delhi. He met with India&#8217;s leading army, navy and air force officials before leaving for a short visit to Jammu and Kashmir. Mizrahi, a long-standing officer in the Israeli Defense Force, lectured senior Indian army officers at the Akhnur Military Base, near the Indo-Pakistan border, on the theme of counterterrorism. Later, in Srinagar, Mizrahi and his Indian counterpart, Army Chief Deepak Kapoor agreed to joint counterterrorism activities, notably for Israeli commandoes to train Indian soldiers in urban combat.</p> \\n\\n<p>The Mizrahi visit in 2008 is not extraordinary. He had been to India in February 2007. In June 2007, Major General Moshe Kaplinsky brought a team of IDF officers to Jammu and Kashmir, where they met senior Indian officials at the 16 Corps headquarters at Nagrota in the Jammu region near the India-Pakistan border. Kaplinsky&#8217;s team discussed the problem of infiltration, how militants from the Pakistani side enter the India. The 720-kilometer barbed wire fence, an echo of Israel&#8217;s wall, has not prevented the transit of militants. Kaplinsky came to push other, high-tech means, such as night-vision devices, to help interdict militants. En route to Israel, Kaplinsky&#8217;s team went to the Mumbai-based Western Naval Command.</p> \\n\\n<p>In January 2008, to continue these contacts, the IDF&#8217;s chief, Brigadier General Pinchas Buchris came to India and met the top civilians and the top brass. They discussed the procedures to share intelligence on terrorist activity. A week after Buchris returned to Israel, India&#8217;s Navy Chief Admiral Sureesh Mehta spent time in Jerusalem, meeting IDF heads Gabi Askhenazi and Buchris. Between 2007 and early 2008, all three Indian defense chiefs visited Israel. The framework for these meetings is the 2002 agreement to form an Indo-Israeli Joint Working Group on Counter-Terrorism, a long-standing attempt to create an entente between the armies of India and Israel, and to consolidate the immense arms trade between the two countries (India is now Israel&#8217;s largest arms buyer).</p> \\n\\n<p>The impetus for the relations goes back to the 1990s, when the governing Congress Party began to dismantle the dirigiste Indian State and to withdraw from India&#8217;s long-standing non-aligned policy. The Congress government believed that it was time to reassess its relations with the United States, and that the best way to get to Washington was through Tel Aviv. Stronger ties with Israel might soften the reticence in Washington toward India, and lead it to loosen its bonds with Pakistan and China. India banked on Israel to play the broker with Washington. (This is the argument of my book, Namaste Sharon: Hindutva and Sharonism Under U. S. Hegemony, New Delhi: LeftWord, 2003).</p> \\n\\n<p>In January 1992, the Indian government recognized the state of Israel. The next month, Defense Minister Sharad Pawar called for Indo-Israeli cooperation on counter-terrorism. Israel&#8217;s Director-General of Police Ya&#8217;acov Lapidot visited India for an international police convention, and returned to Israel with news that the Indian government wanted Israeli expertise on counter-terror operations. Government spokesperson Benjamin Netanyahu told India Abroad (29 February 1992) that Israel &#8220;developed expertise in dealing with terrorism at the field level and also internationally, at the political and legal level, and would be happy to share it with India.&#8221; In the Congress years, the main arena of cooperation came in arms deals, as India&#8217;s massive purchases provided stability to Israel&#8217;s previously volatile arms industry.</p> \\n\\n<p>When the Hindu Right came to power in the late 1990s, it hastened both the economic &#8220;liberalization&#8221; policy (with a Minister for Privatization in office) and it shifted its attentions to Washington, DC and Tel Aviv: an axis of the three powers against what it called Islamic terrorism was to be the new foundation of India&#8217;s emergent foreign policy. The close relationship between Netanyahu (then Prime Minister) and L. K. Advani (the Home Minister of India, and a brigand of the Hard Right) smoothed the path to intensive collaboration. Advani admires Netanyahu&#8217;s personal history as a member of the Sayeret Matcal (special forces) unit of the IDF; Advani himself has no such on-the-ground experience. In 1995, when in Israel, Advani happily received Netanyahu&#8217;s new book, Fighting Terrorism: How Democracies Can Defeat Domestic and International Terrorism.</p> \\n\\n<p>Advani has since made it his practice to quote from the book, particularly the view that a &#8220;free society must know what they are fighting,&#8221; which is the &#8220;rising tide of Islamic terrorism.&#8221; This was all honey in Advani&#8217;s ear. He drew the central concepts of his counter-terrorism policy from his friends in the Israeli government: a wall at the border, threats of &#8220;hot pursuit&#8221; across it; demur against political negotiation, escalation of rhetoric; limits on civil liberties when it comes to suspects in terror cases. Netanyahu had purposely refused to distinguish between Iran and Syria, Hezbollah and Hamas, the PLO and the Muslim Brotherhood. Advani too began to collapse the distinction between Kashmiri separatist groups and post-Afghan war terror outfits based in Pakistan, between aggrieved Indian Muslims and Pakistani proxy forces. As well, Netanyahu and Advani crafted a stage on which to enact an endless battle between Democracy and Terrorism, where the role of Democracy is played by the United States, Israel and India and where the role of Terrorism is played by Islam. It is all simple and dangerous.</p> \\n\\n<p>During his June 2000 visit to Israel, Advani underscored his adoption of Netanyahu&#8217;s framework during a lecture at the Indian Embassy. &#8220;In recent years we have been facing a growing internal security problem,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are concerned with cross-border terrorism launched by proxies of Pakistan. We share with Israel a common perception of terrorism as a menace, even more so when coupled with religious fundamentalism. Our mutual determination to combat terrorism is the basis for discussions with Israel, whose reputation in dealing with such problems is quite successful.&#8221; Advani invited a team of Israeli counter-terrorism experts to tour Jammu and Kashmir in September 2000. Led by Eli Katzir, an aide to Prime Minister Ehud Barak, the team conducted a feasibility study of India&#8217;s military security needs and offered suggestions for Israeli assistance. Three years later, Israel and India signed a military-arms pact that included a specific training mission. Israeli forces would train four new Special Forces battalions of the Indian Army; other battalions would learn the practice of &#8220;irregular warfare&#8221; and work with the Northern Command in Kashmir.</p> \\n\\n<p>When the Hindu Right lost the election in 2004 to a Congress-led alliance, the pace of contacts lessened. With both Advani and Netanyahu in the shadows, the alliance lost its main champions. The Congress government recognized how toxic this alliance would be, unnecessarily inflaming an already difficult relationship with Pakistan. This was also recognized within Israel. Efraim Inbar, director of Israel&#8217;s Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies, who is actively involved in the Indo-Israeli contacts, recognizes the political problem; &#8220;this kind of cooperation needs to be secret if it can be,&#8221; he told Newsweek. The military and arms deals between India and Israel continued, even if it was now treated as a sideshow. India remains a major importer of Israeli arms. What lingers in the shadows is the Israeli work in Kashmir. Little is officially revealed of it, even as leaks here and there hint at the extent of the contacts.</p> \\n\\n<p>Technocrats of Terrorism.</p> \\n\\n<p>Ami Pedazhur, a political scientist from the University of Austin-Texas, joins the chorus on the New York Times op-ed page with suggestions for the Indian government after Mumbai (&#8220;From Munich to Mumbai,&#8221; December 20). Rather than see anything new in the Mumbai attacks, Pedazhur conjoins it with an unbroken history that stretches back at least to the 1972 Munich attacks. What links Munich to Mumbai is neither the identity of those who kill nor those who are killed, but the means by which the killing occurs. Analysts of terrorism, like Pedazhur, are technocrats of counter-terrorist actions. They study how terrorists operate, and so what best security and military force can constrain them. The public policy that stems from this sort of technocratic view of terrorism has one end, to restrain the terrorist with more security checkpoints, more hot pursuit.</p> \\n\\n<p>Why does the Indian government take advice from a government whose own security services have a dismal record of preventing terror attacks and whose own armed forces have failed to create stability on its borders? Israel&#8217;s weaponry works fine. But Israel&#8217;s counter-terror expertise is questionable. Pedazhur takes pride in Israel&#8217;s counterterrorism policy. What pride there can be in a regime that maintains its safety through a ruthless military strategy is questionable. The Israeli government, regardless of the party in charge, is conspicuous not only for its treatment of the Palestinians but also, significantly, for its failure to create a secure society for its own citizens. It is easy enough to make the Palestinians the author of the troubles, but this of course ignores the intransigence of Israel&#8217;s political leadership to produce a settlement. Because it cannot make a political peace, the Israeli authorities have perfected various technological means to minimize the consequences of its failures. This is what it wishes to export to India. For India, the imports signal the surrender of its leadership to the current imbroglio. Gated countries wallow in fear and hatred.</p> \\n\\n<p>The costs of the Tel Aviv-New Delhi-Washington axis are too much to bear, at least for India. India cannot afford to mimic Israel&#8217;s failed neighborhood policy, nor can it follow the U. S. example that seeks to solve its problems by aerial bombardment. South Asia requires a regional solution to what is without doubt a regional problem, one with its roots in the Afghan jihad of the 1980s as much as the unresolved Kashmir question (with close to a million troops in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, the Indian government runs what is tantamount to an occupation &#8211; they provide the opposite of security for the residents of the state). When the Afghan civil wars came to a unjust quiet in the early 1990s, the various foreign fighters returned to their homelands, emboldened by their self-perception of their victorious struggle: they went to Chechnya, the Philippines, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and into the Kashmir struggle. Pakistan and India are equally victims of these veterans of the jihad, and both have a vested interest in their demobilization. But more than that, there is a danger that as the U. S. amps up its war in Afghanistan and treats Pakistan with contempt, the jihadis&amp;#160; will take out their wrath with the same kind of ferocity as they demonstrated in Mumbai. Rather than risk a failed military strategy against the jihadis, it is time for a regional conference on human security, one that includes better cooperation between the states and a program for the lives of those who are driven to the compounds of hatred through their many, many grievances.</p> \\n\\n<p>VIJAY PRASHAD is the George and Martha Kellner Chair of South Asian History and Director of International Studies at Trinity College, Hartford, CT His new book is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1565847857/counterpunchmaga\" type=\"external\">The Darker Nations: A People&#8217;s History of the Third World,</a> New York: The New Press, 2007.

That is a 1,300 percent increase in three years. Added to that is the unlisted number of pending applications, applications on hold, and waiting list applications for registration.</p> \\n\\n<p>Currently, the CGF has pending handgun license-relating lawsuits against Los Angeles Sheriff Lee Baca and Santa Clara Sheriff Laurie Smith for Second Amendment violations. Combs said he expects the number of lawsuits to increase. The organization is a 501(c)3 nonprofit and aims to defend the Second Amendment and &#8220;related civil rights.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Another <a href=\"http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/california\" type=\"external\">source</a> shows California gun ownership has increased by 47 percent from 1981 to 1990, and by 58 percent from 2001 to 2010. On the other hand, the total California deaths from firearms have decreased from 3,054 in 1999 to 2,942 in 2014. These statistics suggest the increase of registered handheld guns is positively correlated with the decrease in gun attacks in California.</p> \\n\\n<p>The study also shows an increase of interstate criminal gun trafficking in the state of California since jurisdiction was passed on gun control. Gun regulation in California is currently categorized as &#8220;restrictive,&#8221; relative to other states. The state of California does not recognize the right to private gun ownership at the same level as federal law.</p> \\n\\n<p>California gun free zones include state/local buildings, public places, public transit facilities, polling places, vehicles, and schools.</p> \\n\\n<p>Combs says he thinks the total number of California gun licensees is &#8220;still far too low.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Unconstitutional policies are still preventing tens of millions of law-abiding Californians from exercising their fundamental Constitutional rights.

              " 7360: '<p><a href=\"\" type=\"internal\" />Navigating the choppy regulatory waters of America&#8217;s 50 states just became more difficult for Uber. The fast-growing startup that has roiled the taxi and livery industry was&amp;#160;dealt&amp;#160;an adverse ruling by the California Labor Commissioner&#8217;s Office. As the New York Times <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/18/business/uber-contests-california-labor-ruling-that-says-drivers-should-be-employees.html?_r=0\" type=\"external\">reported</a>, the CLC&amp;#160;found that&amp;#160;a onetime Uber driver&amp;#160;should have been &#8220;classified as an employee, not an independent contractor.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The initial damage to Uber was minimal. The ruling applied to one person, not an entire class, and because&amp;#160;Uber&amp;#160;immediately appealed, it has&amp;#160;not yet had&amp;#160;to change the way it does business. Nevertheless, Uber&#8217;s business model has been thrown into greater legal question than ever &#8212; along with potentially many similar startups. In recent years, the success of the non-employee model has&amp;#160;flourished across so many sectors of the economy&amp;#160;that &#8220;Uber for (fill in the blank)&#8221; has become a running joke in tech and media circles.</p> \\n\\n<p>The CLC did not hesitate to raise broader questions about Uber&#8217;s business practices. &#8220;While Uber has long positioned itself as merely an app that connects drivers and passengers &#8212; with no control over the hours its drivers work &#8212; the labor office cited many instances in which it said Uber acted more like an employer,&#8221; according to the Times.</p> \\n\\n<p>In a portentous remark making the rounds online, the CLC <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/uber-drivers-in-california-should-unionize-immediately-2015-6\" type=\"external\">said</a> Uber was &#8220;involved in every aspect of the operation&#8221; performed by its service, not a&amp;#160;&#8220;neutral technological platform&#8221; that allows &#8220;drivers and passengers to transact the business of transportation.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>That language had the power to hit Uber where it hurts &#8212; not in the regulatory field, but in the pocketbook. &#8220;Uber&#8217;s vast business and multi-billion dollar valuation&amp;#160;fundamentally depends on its assumption that drivers are independent contractors, and not employees,&#8221; <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2015/06/17/uber_drivers_ruled_employees_by_california_labor_commission.html\" type=\"external\">observed</a> a staff writer at Slate. &#8220;When drivers are treated as contractors, they carry the bulk of the company&#8217;s operating costs. Uber drivers are required to pay out of pocket for everything from gas to insurance to routine car cleanings and maintenance. It adds up fast.&#8221; If Uber must bear even a portion of those costs, driving down its profit margins and growth potential, the market&#8217;s reaction could be substantial and adverse.</p> \\n\\n<p>Adding to the uncertainty, however, was the biggest regulatory question raised by the ruling: can the Golden State&#8217;s&amp;#160;Uber drivers unionize? &#8220;They already have an interest group, the&amp;#160;California App-Based Drivers&#8217; Association,&#8221; as Business Insider <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/uber-drivers-in-california-should-unionize-immediately-2015-6\" type=\"external\">noted</a>. &#8220;And the group has met with the&amp;#160;Teamsters Local 986 in El Monte, California.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Last August, Business Insider continued, the Teamsters complained that &#8220;Uber management flatly refused to sit with members of CADA&#8217;s steering committee, and privately stated that it does not, and will not recognize any association that seeks to speak on behalf of drivers&#8221; &#8212; actions which, the Teamsters said, caused CADA to reach out &#8220;for&amp;#160;organizational and lobbying assistance.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The CLC&#8217;s ruling quickly helped cement the sense that the regulatory tide may be turning against Uber nationwide. Earlier in the year, Reuters <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/18/us-uber-california-idUSKBN0OX1TE20150618\" type=\"external\">reported</a>, a state agency in Florida ruled Uber drivers to be employees. Earlier this month, &#8220;Uber lost a bid to force arbitration in a federal lawsuit brought in San Francisco by its drivers. Earlier this year, the same U.S. District Court rejected Uber&#8217;s bid to classify its drivers as independent contractors, saying a jury would rule on their status.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Ironically, Uber and other rideshare services like Lyft had just scored a legislative victory in Sacramento. &#8220;After the companies began rolling out a feature allowing multiple passengers to split their fares and be dropped off in different destinations,&#8221; the Sacramento Bee <a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article21693111.html\" type=\"external\">reported</a>, &#8220;the California Public Utilities Commission said state law would need to be tweaked to allow the option. Assembly Bill 1360 responds to that directive, drawing support both from the companies and from a range of environmental groups. It passed 69-0.&#8221; But another bill that would mandate background tests and drug tests for drivers has cleared two committees to date, the Bee added.</p>',\n",

              " 7408: '<p>I first became aware of Donald Trump when he chose to make cheating on his first wife front-page news. It was the early &#8217;90s. Donald and Ivana Trump broke up over the course of months. Not that divorce is shocking, mind you. Among the glitterati marriage seems more unusual. Nor is infidelity exactly novel. But it requires a particular breed of lowlife to advertise the sexual superiority of one&#8217;s mistress over the mother of one&#8217;s children. That was Trump&#8217;s style. He leaked stories to the New York tabloids about Ivana&#8217;s breast implants &#8212; they didn&#8217;t feel right. Marla Maples, by contrast, suited him better. She, proving her suitability for the man she was eager to steal from his family, told the papers that her encounters with the mogul were &#8220;the best sex I&#8217;ve ever had.&#8221; It wasn&#8217;t just Donald Trump&#8217;s betrayal that caught my eye, nor just the tawdriness &#8212; it was the cruelty.</p> \\n\\n<p>That&#8217;s the part of the Trump rise that is quite shocking. Most politicians, for as long as I can remember, have been at considerable pains to present themselves as nicer, nobler, and more empathetic than they really are. Since many of them (not all) are selfish egotists, this requires some skill. Now comes Trump unblushingly parading his viciousness &#8212; by, for example, mocking a handicapped man, toying with white supremacism, or encouraging political violence &#8212; and still gaining the loyalty of a plurality of Republicans.</p> \\n\\n<p>One can imagine why voters might tolerate a little nastiness in certain situations. It&#8217;s possible that the threat of ISIS-style war crimes makes a would-be leader who vows to commit war crimes of his own seem palatable, or even &#8220;strong.&#8221; It&#8217;s not a total surprise that a regime of stifling political correctness would evoke a reaction.</p> \\n\\n<p>But voters are venturing way out on a plank with Trump &#8212; and I&#8217;m not speaking here of the fact that he is overwhelmingly likely to lose to Hillary Clinton if he&#8217;s the Republican nominee. No, I&#8217;m referring to the copious evidence that if he won, he could cause catastrophic damage to the country.</p> \\n\\n<p>Donald Trump is not emotionally healthy. No normal man sits up late at night tweeting dozens of insults about Megyn Kelly, or skips a key debate because he&#8217;s nursing a grudge against her for asking perfectly ordinary questions, or continues to obsess about her weeks and months after the fact.</p> \\n\\n<p>A normal, well-adjusted man does not go to great lengths to prove to a random journalist that he has normal sized fingers. Some may think it was Rubio who introduced the &#8220;small hands&#8221; business, but it actually dates back to an encounter Trump had 25 years ago with journalist Graydon Carter. Carter had referred to Trump as a &#8220;short-fingered vulgarian&#8221; in Spy magazine. Trump could not let it go. Carter told Vanity Fair in 2015:</p> \\n\\n<p>To this day, I receive the occasional envelope from Trump. There is always a photo of him &#8212; generally a tear sheet from a magazine. On all of them he has circled his hand in gold Sharpie in a valiant effort to highlight the length of his fingers . . . The most recent offering arrived earlier this year, before his decision to go after the Republican presidential nomination. Like the other packages, this one included a circled hand and the words, also written in gold Sharpie: &#8216;See, not so short!&#8217;</p> \\n\\n<p>Notice he didn&#8217;t contest the &#8220;vulgarian&#8221; part of the insult. And remember that at a presidential debate, for God&#8217;s sake, Trump brought it up himself and assured the world that &#8220;there is no problem, believe me.&#8221; I don&#8217;t believe him, and I&#8217;m not talking about his genitals.</p> \\n\\n<p>There is an enormous problem. Trump seems to suffer from narcissistic personality disorder, an insecurity so consuming and crippling that he has devoted his life to self-aggrandizement. This is far beyond the puffery that most salesmen indulge to some degree. It strays well into the bizarre. Asked who he consults on foreign policy Trump said &#8220;I&#8217;m speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I&#8217;ve said a lot of things.&#8221; What grown man says things like that and continues to be taken seriously? How can he be leading the race for the Republican nomination?</p> \\n\\n<p>People with severe ego weakness are to be pitied &#8212; but also feared. Everything Trump says and does is a form of self-medication for a damaged soul. His need to disparage others, to glorify himself, and to be the &#8220;strong man&#8221; could lead to disastrous judgments by the man in charge of the nuclear codes.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8212; Mona Charen is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.

              " 7422: '<p>(Daily Beast) &#8211; If these were ordinary times, a happy warrior like Joe Biden would be first out of the starting gate in the race for president. It would be so easy; politicking is what he loves to do.</p> \\n\\n<p>But with Hillary Clinton so dominant in the polls, Biden is hanging back, watching and waiting to see if maybe there&#8217;s an opening. He&#8217;s telling supporters in the early states that he&#8217;ll decide in the next four weeks, or by end of summer.</p> \\n\\n<p>On that thin thread, Draft Biden 2016, a SuperPAC designed to draft him into the race, is lining up endorsements in Iowa, the first contest, and organizing house parties and meet ups across the country, from Maryland to Alaska.</p> \\n\\n<p><a href=\"http://thecrux.com/dyncontent/psi-5-book_lookwhosgoingbankruptnextinamerica_cid_03022015/?cid=MKT015071&amp;amp;eid=MKT041077&amp;amp;snaid=&amp;amp;step=start\" type=\"external\">Special Headline: Guess Who&#8217;s About To Go Bankrupt in America [Learn More]</a></p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Our goal is to have one party in each state, including Alaska,&#8221; says executive director Will Pierce.</p> \\n\\n<p>Even Alaska?</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;I just like to say that. I&#8217;ve been doing national campaigns for years, and I never heard anybody say that. Support for the vice president is strong, even in the last frontier!&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Pierce did advance work for Obama in &#8217;08 and &#8217;12, but he&#8217;s a novice at fundraising, the coin of the realm for &#8217;16. He says Draft Biden has one or two major donors, and is on track to hit half a million by the end of the quarter when contributions are reported to the FEC.</p> \\n\\n<p>This is chump change in presidential politics.</p> \\n\\n<p>What Draft Biden hopes to generate is enthusiasm, and it&#8217;s priceless. Pierce, 26, and his communications director, Ahmed Khan, are millennials, and the &#8220;I&#8217;m Ridin With Biden&#8221; bumper stickers you can get for five bucks are pretty cool.</p> \\n\\n<p>The vice president is wearing his trademark aviator sunglasses and driving a Corvette, the image rendered in psychedelic colors like the iconic &#8220;Hope&#8221; poster in &#8217;08 of Barack Obama.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;I have nothing but respect for her (Hillary Clinton), but eight years ago, she was inevitable, and look what happened. It&#8217;s like the play offs, you want to make sure your candidate is ready,&#8221; says Pierce. Watching the parade of GOP hopefuls at the Faith and Freedom Summit in Iowa earlier this month, a Draft Biden supporter said jokingly that he wanted the podium rental business when the Republicans were in town.</p> \\n\\n<p>The commercial interests and the enthusiasm that is generated by a competitive campaign is what a lot of politics is about especially in the early contests. Iowa State Senator Tony Bisignano says he would rather Biden decide to run and not bother with the draft, that Iowa needs him to get people interested and young people excited. Bisignano has supported Biden since his first run for the presidency in 1988, and again in 2008 &#8220;I&#8217;ve taken him everywhere from the state fair to church. Everyone loves Joe.&#8221; &amp;#160;A recent Quinnipiac poll of Iowa Democratic caucus goers puts Biden&#8217;s favorability rating at 79 percent. Even with the secret service, Bisignano notes that Biden is able to &#8220;bust loose.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not having a contest, we&#8217;re having a coronation,&#8221; Bisignano says, and that&#8217;s a hardship for Iowa Democrats. With a Republican governor, two Republican senators, and a Republican House, the only body the Democrats control is the Iowa senate, and that&#8217;s by the closest of margins (26 &#8211; 24). &amp;#160;To build excitement, they need competition. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think Clinton&#8217;s brief appearances here are going to cut it,&#8221; says Bisignano.</p> \\n\\n<p>Iowa Democrat Jim Lykam agrees, that&#8217;s why he agreed to sign a letter along with several other Iowa lawmakers urging Biden to run.</p> \\n\\n<p>Lykam, a long-time Biden supporter, said when the veep is in town Biden will have the secret service call ahead that he wants to see Lykam, which makes the eight-term Davenport lawmaker feel pretty special. In their last conversation about 2016, Biden said, &#8220;Jim, you&#8217;re going to be one of the first to know,&#8221; a promise the veep no doubt has made to countless others who consider him their friend.</p> \\n\\n<p>Primary fights can get very bitter and personal, yet what&#8217;s most striking about the Draft Biden effort is how civil everything seems to be, at least so far. If Biden declines to get into the race, Draft Biden &#8216;16 will support Clinton, no question. The doubts that emerge around Clinton for these Democrats center on her struggle to relate to voters in the same way her husband is able to do, and that Biden does so easily.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;For her, it&#8217;s like having to join a fraternity or a sorority, there&#8217;s pledge week and hell week,&#8221; says Dick Harpootlian, former Democratic Party chairman in South Carolina, who tells of taking six hours to play golf with Biden because the veep felt an obligation to chat up everyone on the course.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;He relates to everybody,&#8221; says Harpootlian, who is advising Draft Biden &#8216;16.</p> \\n\\n<p>Once a self-described &#8220;vociferous&#8221; Clinton supporter &#8212; he went door-to-door in New Hampshire with Bill in &#8217;92 &#8212; he chose Obama in early &#8217;07 despite his historical ties with the Clintons. &#8220;It&#8217;s more than charisma; it&#8217;s more than the ability to emote; it&#8217;s the ability to speak to 25,000 people and have every one of them feel you&#8217;re speaking to them. Clinton had it, Bush had it, Obama had it, Reagan had it. Joe Biden has it &#8212; he can bring people to tears. She ain&#8217;t got it.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>After cornering the market on enthusiasm in the last two elections, these Democrats, all men perhaps not coincidentally, worry that the promise of electing the first woman president may not be enough to rally an electorate groomed by cable television and social media to expect the raw emotion of political combat. But it may be enough to deter Biden.</p> \\n\\n<p>http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/05/19/are-you-ready-for-president-biden.html</p>',\n",

The tactic puts pressure on the property owners instead of the tenants, highlighting increasingly aggressive maneuvers being employed by the Justice Department against dispensaries in states that permit medical marijuana use.</p> \\n\\n<p>Local officials and medical marijuana advocates have called the move to seize Harborside Health&#8217;s business highly suspect, considering the facility has often been looked to as a model for compliance with state medical cannabis laws as well as garnering the support of local officials who appreciate the healthy sales/state income tax hauls.</p> \\n\\n<p>Nancy Nadel, Oakland&#8217;s Vice Mayor and member of the City Council said in a statement:</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;The city of Oakland has developed a system to assure such distribution occurs according to state law in a fair and orderly process. It is most unjust to our citizen patients and distributors who have followed local guidelines to be harassed and treated as criminals by federal officials.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>In response to federal actions against Harborside, State Board of Equalization member Betty Yee told the LA Times, &#8220;If we continue to drive everything underground, we&#8217;re going to create an unsafe environment for patients who need this product &#8230; and lose revenue.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Understandably, the issue has states&#8217; rights and medical marijuana advocates in an uproar.

Well, almost formally. As IVN has <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">reported</a> in 2010, the feds actually hold a patent on therapeutic cannabinoids &#8212; the active ingredients in a marijuana plant.</p> \\n\\n<p>Its no wonder that a growing movement of academics and health officials are calling on the federal executive to reassess its current classification of marijuana as a Schedule I substance, a ranking that makes marijuana supposedly more dangerous than cocaine and denotes that it has &#8220;no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.&#8221; Director at CMCR Igor Grant concludes in the study that marijuana is in practice more fit to be classified as a Schedule III drug and that &#8220;the continuing controversy as to whether or not cannabis is of medical value&#8221; is an &#8220;obstacle to medical progress.&#8221;</p>',\n",

              " 7523: '<p>My contribution to this year&#8217;s Handel commemorations is to give the great man his feet back. The impetus for this anatomical reconstruction stems from disagreements that rippled the waters in the later 18th century, long after both Bach and Handel were dead. It was the great musical tourist and historian, Charles Burney who threw the first stone into the pond in which the legacies of both men were reflected. Burney published an account of the Handel celebrations in London in 1784, held during what was mistakenly thought to be the centennial of his birth. Burney wrote that Handel&#8217;s &#8220;full, masterly, and excellent organ-fugues, upon the most natural and pleasing subjects, surpassed &#8230; even those of Sebastian Bach, the most renowned for his abilities in this difficult and elaborate species of composition.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>This claim provoked a lengthy rebuttal in a widely-circulated German periodical by an anonymous writer, who was none other the Bach&#8217;s second son, Carl Philipp Emanuel. With a watchful eye on his father&#8217;s posthumous reputation, Emanuel was offended, not least because he knew that English organs, with a very few exceptions, didn&#8217;t even have pedals. Deprived of the chance to use the&amp;#160; feet, no organist could produce a valid fugue for the king of instruments: &#8220;One may assume without fear of contradiction that the pedal is the most important part of an organ, without which it would have little of that majesty, greatness, and power that belong to it alone above all other instruments. Anyone who knows at all what the word &#8216;organ&#8217; means will grant that. What shall we say, then, if Handel almost completely neglected and seldom used the very thing that makes an organ an organ, and lifts it so high above all other instruments?&amp;#160; Not at all because he was completely lacking in the necessary genius, but because he was not practiced on the pedals, or because he was compelled, as an Englishman, to renounce the experience of the pedals that, as a German, he had possessed.&#8221; It is inevitable that C. P. E. Bach comes to this summary judgment: &#8220;If we weigh the organ works of the two men in the same scales, there is a difference as wide as the sky in favor of J. S. B.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>So for 2009 I&#8217;ve been taking various pieces by Handel, both famous and somewhat neglected, and giving them robust pedal lines to be displayed on larger 18th-century German style organs that have been sprouting up across America. (This prologue has been rambling towards the following plug: on March 8 and 10th I&#8217;ll be in <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Yuba City and in Chico California&#8217;s Central Valley</a>, where I let Handel go toe to toe, with his exact contemporary J. S. Bach.)</p> \\n\\n<p>This past week I crammed Handel in my briefcase, and he and I drove to New Haven, Connecticut where Yale University now has one of the finest <a href=\"http://www.taylorandboody.com/opuses/opus_55_pages/opus_55_finished_a.html\" type=\"external\">Baroque organs in the world</a>.</p> \\n\\n<p>We headed southwest out of Ithaca on New York Route 79 on the way to connect with the trio of highways &#8212;I 81 south to Binghamton, New York 17 and I -84 East into Connecticut&#8212;that will bring us to within range of New Haven. Twenty miles from Ithaca we pass through the battered hamlet of Richford where John D. Rockefeller was born to humble beginnings in 1839.&amp;#160; If anything, life has gotten still more humble in Richford. The Gospel of Wealth has not led this place to the Promised Land.&amp;#160; The best that can be hoped for in the rusting trailers is the other gospel: &#8220;Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>I don&#8217;t spend much time in a car, so I use a road trip like this one to recapture something of those endless adolescent evenings of listening to LPs on twenty pound headphones. Music!</p> \\n\\n<p>To get me the hour from the small roads to the big ones, Handel and I have brought along saxophonist Steve Elson&#8217;s new release <a href=\"http://www.steveelson.com/\" type=\"external\">Mott &amp;amp; Broome</a>. I say saxophonist, but Elson is not only a multi-threat reed player (he&#8217;s heard on the disc on baritone, tenor, and soprano saxes, as well a Bb and Eb clarinets), but also a composer of great imagination and fluency, whose music delights through its warmth and humor and through a temperament that favors subtlety as against exhibitionist bluster. All of the disc&#8217;s thirteen tracks are Elson originals. These survey many familiar styles&#8212;Ellingtonian swing, sundry Latin grooves, exotic Mozarabicisms&#8212;but always with a flair that nudges the genre he&#8217;s exploring in and towards unexpected places.</p> \\n\\n<p>The opening track, like several others on the CD, finds Elson in a Gilberto/Getz mood, but with an urban, northern edge. &#8220;Remember This&#8221; begins with a unison motto, repeated insistently by guitar and saxophone. This invocation to dance is then pushed aside by a rush of humid breeze and music of exhilarating warmth, like that first sip of a Mojito sluicing away all the troubles in the world.&amp;#160; Within two minutes this tune, with its unexpected inflections of melody, piquant harmonic turns, and hip counterpoint between saxophone and guitar, lets us know we&#8217;ve got a great album stretching ahead of you like a long tropical night. The pressing unison figures between guitar and saxophone return to introduce Elson&#8217;s short but sweet solo, which remains mostly near the upper register, bluesy and suggesting urgency. His improvising is of a piece with his composing.</p> \\n\\n<p>Elson&#8217;s quartet is filled out by Scott Latzky on drums, Yasushi Makamura on bass, and Pete Misth on nine-string quartet and is joined by singer Jennifer Griffith on four tunes with smart and often very funny lyrics by CounterPunch contributor Daniel Wolff. Griffith has a pure, yet expressive voice, and a sure sense of pitch that allows her to follow Elson&#8217;s melodies to unexpected destinations, at several lovely moments even to a tone a lower than the place to which more conventional musical syntax might have sent them.&amp;#160; The disarming quality of Griffith&#8217;s voice heard in counterpoint with the knowing sensuality of Elson&#8217;s saxophone compound and enrich some of Wolff&#8217;s brilliantly ironic lines, as in the title track&#8217;s evocation of his neighborhood in Lower Manhattan at &#8220;Mott and Broome&#8221;: &#8220;From the murder at the sweat shop / To the murder at the drug drop&#8221;&#8212;again heard against a laid-back Latin rhythm. This is music you want to listen to again because it delivers on all its promises, because Elson&#8217;s is a warm and welcoming originality, and because there are more than few hidden shoals.</p> \\n\\n<p>Elson gets me through rust-belt Binghamton and onto New York 17 heading due East. Green signs promise &#8220;Future 86&#8221;&#8212;the Interstate of tomorrow.&amp;#160; It is a philosophically complicated, not to say mind-blowing, sign, and I&#8217;ve been scheming for years to steal one.&amp;#160; Eighty-six means to nix something, or more specifically to throw them out of&amp;#160; bar or restaurant [see the late Danny Cassidy&#8217;s How the Irish Invented slang for the phrase&#8217;s Gaelic origins, Editors] and this sign wants to do this in the future &#8230; with an Interstate Highway.</p> \\n\\n<p>Since I&#8217;m heading to New Haven I&#8217;ve brought along The Complete Blue Note Hank Mobley Fifties Sessions issued in a limited edition of 7,500 by Mosaic Records ten years ago. <a href=\"http://www.mosaicrecords.com/default.asp\" type=\"external\">Mosaic</a>is based in Stamford just down the road from New Haven and still offers wonderful collections of jazz greats. The round-trip to New Haven will now be dedicated to the six Mobley CDs.&amp;#160; A great tenor player in an era overflowing with greats (Coltrane, Rollins, Gordon to name only three), Mobley is perhaps best known for his work on Miles Davis&#8217; Someday My Prince Will Come of 1961.&amp;#160; There is so much more than that. In the second half of the fifties he was recording indefatigably for several labels in attempt to find outlets for his creativity and to feed his drug habit. At the cathedral of hard bop that was Blue Note, Mobley was the dean, and this box set rejuvenates his legacy in a thousand ways; one of the most compelling being through the crucible of the alternate takes included in the collection. This was a man with huge talent and taste, inventiveness, fleetness, compositional range and flair. And then there&#8217;s the way he brings out the best in a host of celebrated collaborators. Some five years ago I got number 1,181 of the 7,500 boxes produced back in 1998.&amp;#160; Hurry to the Mosaic website and discover the mastery of Mobley, while supplies last &#8230;</p> \\n\\n<p>Thirty miles beyond Binghamton, with Hank and his running mates happily working their way through ten minutes of &#8220;Barrel of Funk,&#8221; Handel and I arrive at the last traffic light on 17 in this entire stretch of highway. Embracing an elusive future, the 17 Diner has changed its name to the I-86 Diner since last I was here a few years ago.&amp;#160; I pull in for coffee out of respect for this old New York highway separated from oblivion by a single traffic light.</p> \\n\\n<p>I take a seat on the pink Naugahyde at the light green formic bar and get my coffee. I ask the waitresses about when Future I 86 will become the living present, and if Obama&#8217;s stimulus package might be just the thing to usher in that reality.&amp;#160; &#8220;They&#8217;ve been talking about it for thirty years,&#8221; says one of them. And what would an overpass and the removal of the intersection mean for business at the diner?&amp;#160; That questions elicits only shrugs and a rueful joke from one of the waitress about &#8220;maybe we&#8217;ll be just eighty-sixing ourselves.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Back in the car it&#8217;s the fast, but not furious, &#8220;Double Whammy.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>I leave Future 86 for Present I 84 and cross the Hudson at Newburgh.&amp;#160; In the Connecticut Hills I pass by the Federal prison where some many of the illustrious have cooled their heals: Robert Lowell for refusing to serve in World War II, Ring Lardner, Jr. for refusing to testify before HUAC, Sun Myung Moon for tax evasion, and, since the huge facility was converted to a super-low security country club for wayward women alone,&amp;#160; Leon Helmsley and Martha Stewart. Mobley&#8217;s into &#8220;Funk in Deep Freeze&#8221; Another hour on and I exit onto Connecticut Route 34 then takes me down along the Housatonic River, with its ice fisherman contemplating life in the shadow of million dollar cheek-by-jowl mansion. From postindustrial ruins of Derby it&#8217;s a few short miles to the surrounding ghettos of New Haven and into the City of God laid out by the Puritans. As I motor along the New Haven Green past the homeless sitting on the on benches in front the colonial churches and within a beer can&#8217;s throw from Yale&#8217;s Old Campus, it&#8217;s Mobley&#8217;s &#8220;Startin&#8217; From Scratch.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>DAVID YEARSLEY teaches at Cornell University.

FPPC chair Ann Ravel says this points to &#8220;quite serious&#8221; issues and that no other treasurers have such a history of violations. The FPPC is (probably deliberately) underfunded and understaffed, so it can basically only go after the big cases.

They ordered it to stop providing accounting services, adding they&#8217;d never even heard of Durkee until her arrest. &amp;#160; Thus they appear to have galloped to the rescue after the battle was lost.</p> \\n\\n<p>What is most astonishing about this sad affair is that politicians gave Durkee complete power over the bank accounts and apparently didn&#8217;t ask for online access or monthly statements, or seem to be paying much attention to what she was doing. Certainly Durkee was completely trusted. Her arrest and the missing money must be devastating to those politicians, who probably considered her a friend.

That&#8217;s why Mao Zedong came here for a month in 1930 &#8211; almost two decades before taking power. &amp;#160;He came to the county seat, Chengning, which was then a dusty little village of about 1500 people. &amp;#160;He wanted to understand the problems and aspirations of villagers, and to see how the class system worked here.</p> \\n\\n<p>The house where Mao stayed &#8211; its long wooden frame built by an American missionary &#8211; is now a museum. &amp;#160;Visitors can gaze at the iron-frame twin bed where Mao slept, the desk where he worked the long plank table where he sat and talked with locals. &amp;#160;He met with farmers, merchants, local officials, an imperial scholar, even disaffected youth. &amp;#160;He noted, in colorful detail, who felt oppressed by whom, how the classes interacted, how control of property was key to wealth and power.</p> \\n\\n<p>Assisting Mao was a 24-year-old local named Gu Bo, the son and grandson of landlord. His family was renowned for sending many scholars over the centuries to serve the emperor. But Gu Bo wanted change.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;He thought the old system was unfair,&#8221; says his grand-nephew, Gu Anjiang, who &amp;#160;I caught up with in his village home. &amp;#160;&#8220;So once he joined the Communist revolution, he burned down his grandfather&#8217;s house.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Gu Anjian chuckles affectionately. He&#8217;s now a wizened 74-year-old, retired after 40 years of serving as local village chief. &amp;#160;He sits at a round table in his kitchen with his brother and son and nephew, while the women in the family prepare lunch. &amp;#160;He says, Gu Bo and his brothers were all committed to revolutionary change in China. &amp;#160; Four brothers were on the Long March with Mao. Three died; the fourth was the grandfather of the older men at the kitchen table. &amp;#160;Gu Bo was killed, too, just a few years after working with Mao, believing that Communism was the best way forward to transform and modernize China. &amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>China&#8217;s Communist Party came to power promising to end China&#8217;s traditional class structure. &amp;#160;As it turned out, it turned the class structure on its head. &amp;#160;Scholars, landlords and merchants, the former privileged classes, were stripped of their privileges, and sometimes of their lives. &amp;#160;Villagers and workers were, for a time, &amp;#160;elevated, in status and opportunity. &amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>More than 60 years on, farmers and workers are again at the bottom of the heap, and while there&#8217;s a growing middle class, China has one of the world&#8217;s biggest and fastest growing rates of income disparity., with the privileged and wealthiest class now made up largely of Party officials, their families and friends.&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>The Gu family shows what has and hasn&#8217;t changed in China&#8217;s class structure since Mao Zedong came here more than 80 years ago. &amp;#160;The family used to have more than its share of imperial scholars. &amp;#160; Today, none of the men here have gone beyond ninth grade. &amp;#160;Mao tried to abolish capitalism, but the village chief&#8217;s younger brother, Gu Anjia, did foreign trade in steel. &amp;#160;I ask what he thinks Gu Bo would have thought of his great-nephew making a career of capitalism.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;How would I know what he&#8217;d think? &amp;#160;Anyway, it was a state-run trading company I worked for &#8211; at least at first,&#8221; he says, a little defensively. &amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>But in China, being connected to the state, or the Communist Party, doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re not capitalist. More than 90 percent of China&#8217;s richest people are Party members. &amp;#160;And state-owned enterprises control most of China&#8217;s wealth, because the system is skewed to favor them over private businesses.&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>The disgraced senior official Bo Xilai, former Communist Party chief of Chongqing, used the system to amass great wealth for his family, take down rivals, seize their wealth and sometimes execute them in the name of fighting crime and corruption. &amp;#160;His wife stands accused of murdering a British businessman who reportedly helped the family transfer large sums overseas, and threatened to talk if he wasn&#8217;t paid more for his trouble.</p> \\n\\n<p>China&#8217;s national anthem may exhort the downtrodden, &#8220;arise, those who refuse to be slaves,&#8221; but these days, those who want to get rich join the Party, and the Party wants the rich to join it. &amp;#160;That way, wealth stays concentrated in the hands of its members, who&#8217;ll then have little incentive to change the system. &amp;#160;And it seems to be working. &amp;#160;The richest 70 members of China&#8217;s legislature, the National People&#8217;s Congress, have an average net worth of $1.2 billion. &amp;#160;Each. &amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>The Gu family is not in those ranks. &amp;#160;It may have sacrificed its sons for the Revolution, but the family now lives a simple village life. &amp;#160;The former village chief&#8217;s 36-year-old son, Gu Zisong, scoffs when I ask the family if they&#8217;re proud that their relative worked with Mao to try to make China more egalitarian:&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Pride? &amp;#160;What pride? &amp;#160;If there were any glory in it, we wouldn&#8217;t live here,&#8221; he says.&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>Gu Zisong makes his living growing oranges &#8211; a line of work that has helped pull many farmers in this area out of poverty, since it caught on 7 or 8 years ago. &amp;#160;You can see their profits in the new concrete and brick houses rising up in the village. &amp;#160;Gu Zisong admits, life here is better than when he was a kid. &amp;#160;Back then, he says, the village consisted of mudbrick houses with no electricity or indoor plumbing, and dirt roads that turned to muck in the rain. &amp;#160;Now, the roads are good, and most homes have refrigerators, TVs, even the occasional computer &#8211; which allows them to see that, their lives might have gotten better &#8211; but the elite in China are doing far better still.</p> \\n\\n<p>At the Gu kitchen table, family members include a former local official, a trader and a farmer &#8211; a lot like the classes of people Mao talked to while he was here in 1930. &amp;#160; I ask if they think class divides are still a problem in China. &amp;#160;They seem surprised by the question.&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;No, today&#8217;s China is different,&#8221; says Gu Zisong, the orange farmer. &amp;#160;&#8220;There aren&#8217;t any classes anymore.&#8221; &amp;#160;His cousin chimes in, &#8220;today, it&#8217;s not exploitation. &amp;#160;The people are rich.&#8221; &amp;#160;He pauses, thinks a minute. &amp;#160;&#8220;Actually &#8211; it&#8217;s hard to answer this.&#8221; &amp;#160;It may be hard because, Chinese, from their first days at school, learn that Mao abolished the class system. &amp;#160;So, they figure, any inequalities that exist now &#8211; must be something else.&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>Another Gu has an easier time with the question. &amp;#160;He&#8217;s down the street, where he runs a kindergarten.</p> \\n\\n<p>Gu Yuesheng is 34. &amp;#160;He was a migrant worker for five years, in a sweater factory in a city 250 miles away.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t really like the city,&#8221; he says. &amp;#160;&#8220;People looked down on migrant workers.&#8221; &amp;#160;He says workers were so underpaid and overworked that strikes and protests were common, even though independent trade unions in China are illegal.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;My own boss was ok,&#8221; Gu says. &amp;#160;&#8220;But even in my factory, if you were a migrant worker, you could only move up so far. &amp;#160;The good jobs went to local people.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>So, when Gu Yuesheng had made a bit of money, he came back here, and started his sweater factory. At its peak, he says, it employed more than 120 fellow villagers, and produced four million sweaters a year, sold mostly to the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong. The factory had to close last year, when too many customers went too long without paying.&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;It felt like falling off a cliff,&#8221; he says, shaking his head ruefully.</p> \\n\\n<p>Still, Gu Yuesheng is proud of having helped his fellow villagers get a leg up, without having to go through the hardship and humiliation he did, as a migrant worker. His efforts have also pushed him nicely into China&#8217;s middle class. &amp;#160;It&#8217;s a mobility villagers here didn&#8217;t have at the time Mao visited. &amp;#160;But with wages and expectations rising, Gu Yuesheng doubts the next generation will find it as easy as it was for him, if they&#8217;re not educated. That&#8217;s what the kindergarten is about, he says &#8211; to help kids from this village get a head start, and learn to love learning.</p> \\n\\n<p>Downstairs, one of the kindergarten teachers is singing her lesson of the day, and the kids join in enthusiastically, &amp;#160;In another classroom, the teacher takes a more traditional approach &#8211; calling for the correct answer, and waiting for the kids to all recite it back to her, loudly, in unison. Most of the kids seem to be enjoying themselves, but Gu says, these kids will need more than rote learning to thrive in an IT era. &amp;#160;Almost half of Chinese are already online, and most have mobile phones. &amp;#160;An increasing number are moving to cities and entering the middle class. &amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Without a good education, these kids won&#8217;t have a chance,&#8221; says Gu, who himself only got through middle school. &amp;#160;&#8220;And even then, if you want to move from this village to join the middle class, you have to fight for your life.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Miles down the road, back in the town where Mao stayed when it was just a village, orange farmers lost a fight for their livelihoods, when property developers with the right government contacts won the right to push them out. &amp;#160;The village, Changning, is now a scrappy city of 100,000 people and growing. &amp;#160;Luxury apartment towers are rising like mushrooms, next to a river where poor women still do laundry.</p> \\n\\n<p>In one of the upscale complexes, I find Huang Quanfu, the general manager, talking to a contractor. &amp;#160;The complex is just across the river from a fancy new government building, that&#8217;s lit up at night in gaudy multicolor splendor. &amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>When I drop in, unannounced, Huang is wary. &amp;#160;He asks, &#8220;Are you going to ask any political questions? &amp;#160;We&#8217;re a legal company.&#8221; &amp;#160;But he&#8217;s happy to talk about his project.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got almost 700 apartments, and we&#8217;ve sold most of them,&#8221; he says. &amp;#160;They go for almost $100,000 each. &amp;#160;&#8220;We&#8217;ll be in profit when we sell 80 percent of them.&#8221; &amp;#160;He&#8217;s confident he will. &amp;#160; I ask if that&#8217;s optimistic, given that property prices are dropping in much of China, and that Xunwu is officially ranked as one of China&#8217;s poorest counties. &amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very realistic,&#8221; he says. &amp;#160;&#8220;Almost every Xunwu farmer has orange trees. &amp;#160;They make good money from those, and then move to town so their kids can get a good education. &amp;#160; About one-third of the apartments we&#8217;ve already sold have gone to farmers, and there&#8217;ll be more moving to town, so their kids can get a better education.&#8221;&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>Even if there&#8217;s a temporary drop in property prices, he says, the trend is clear. &amp;#160;China&#8217;s economy will keep growing, and people&#8217;s lives will only get better.&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>The nearby villagers who lost their orange groves to developers, aren&#8217;t so sure. &amp;#160; One is Luo Dingyuan, 66, who lives in a little courtyard house just up a hill from the new apartment complexes, where his family has lived for generations. &amp;#160;He says he used to have an acre of orange trees, which netted him a nice annual income. &amp;#160;But then the government came and said they needed his land for development. &amp;#160;It gave him $48,000 &#8211; not bad, given that most of the 30 million of so rural Chinese who have been turfed off their land in the name of development over the past dozen years got little or nothing. &amp;#160;Even in this area, another group of villagers near here was moved by force, locals say, with some 500 police coming in to clear them. &amp;#160;So Luo Dingyuan could count himself lucky. &amp;#160;He doesn&#8217;t.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;The money might last 10 years &#8211; and then what?,&#8221; he laments. &amp;#160;&#8220;I only has a 2nd grade education. &amp;#160;Farming is all I know, and now, I have no land left to farm.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Luo&#8217;s five grown kids are off as migrant workers, but they barely make enough for themselves. &amp;#160;And his government pension is laughably small &#8211; about $8 a month. &amp;#160;Meanwhile, he sees luxury apartments he&#8217;ll never be able to afford, rising where his orange grove used to be. &amp;#160;It&#8217;s not exactly what Mao had promised villagers here, about how the Communist Revolution would transform their lives and create an egalitarian society. &amp;#160;Luo is old enough to remember when the Communist Party came to power &#8211; and actually, he says, it was never like that here in Changning.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;The central government was good but the local government made it a mess,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We watched the news and it told us the good policies made by the central government for the farmers. But when the policy was carried out locally it was different.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Take the Great Famine of 1959-61, for instance, he says. &amp;#160;There was food, he says, but the local officials took it. &amp;#160;And if farmers tried to hide some food, so they could eat, the officials took that too. &amp;#160;They&#8217;d reported inflated harvest figures to higher authorities, and were now being told to bring in the harvest. &amp;#160;Some 30 to 40 million Chinese starved to death in those years, in a politically politically caused reasons.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;I remember seeing bodies in the road, here,&#8221; he says. &amp;#160;&#8220;Many people starved. &amp;#160;Some tried to go outside the village to forage for food, and the local leaders would hold them back. &amp;#160;But the local leaders had food. &amp;#160;And then they forced us to work in mass production teams.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Without food?,&#8221; I ask.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Without food.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>We sit silent a moment. &amp;#160; He comes back into the present moment.&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;And now, they&#8217;re busy expanding Changning,&#8221; he says. &amp;#160;&#8220;It&#8217;s good for the city to grow, I guess. &amp;#160;But what happens when they finish expanding, and stop construction? &amp;#160;Where can we get jobs, since my land was taken? &amp;#160;How can I live?&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Luo complains that the local government doesn&#8217;t listen to complaints from simple farmers like him; he says they just listen to the bosses of these projects, who pay them off and make the profits.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;In my opinion, it&#8217;s not fair. &amp;#160;&#8220;We have no power, and have no choice but to accept our fate.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Landlords, corrupt officials, underpaid workers, farmers on the short end of the stick. &amp;#160;Sounds a lot like the old class system, doesn&#8217;t it?</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; Luo says. &amp;#160;&#8220;Now, we don&#8217;t have classes in China.&#8221; &amp;#160;He pauses and stares ahead, shoulders hunched, tea mug cupped in his hands. &amp;#160;&#8220;At least &#8211; not like before.&#8221;&amp;#160;</p>',\n",

Another is that Tohona O&#8217;odham tribal land extends from Arizona into Mexico and is thus used by drug and human smugglers.&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>Utah Rep. Rob Bishop <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/06/17/lawmaker-warns-drug-cartel-danger-public-parks-intensifying\" type=\"external\">says</a> the reason the parks on the border are so dangerous is because environmental regulations restrict Border Patrol from using vehicles in those areas. Thus they can&#8217;t patrol effectively. Smugglers know this, and thus use the area more. Turf wars between the Border Patrol and the US Forest Service complicate things further. Republicans are sponsoring <a href=\"http://www.republicans.resourcescommittee.house.gov/Issues/Issue/?IssueID=11663\" type=\"external\">HR 5016</a> to give the Border Patrol more authority at the border. Heavy vehicle use in wildlife areas will almost certainly damage the environment, but the alternative seems worse.&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>Here in California, while the border isn&#8217;t as violent, we have other problems, like <a href=\"http://www.examiner.com/x-35821-Immigration-Reform-Examiner%7Ey2010m6d17-Our-national-parks-have-been-surrendered-to-the-Mexican-drug-cartels-wshocking-video\" type=\"external\">mega-marijuana farms</a> being grown in national and state forest areas. They are often booby-trapped, with the land and streams polluted with pesticides, and water sources diverted. What&#8217;s left when they leave is a wasteland. Then there&#8217;s the August 2009 La Brea fire, which was caused by a cooking fire used by Mexican marijuana growers.&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s estimated that at least 50% of drug cartel profits comes from marijuana. Along with a sensible, sane, effective border policy (which we don&#8217;t have now), maybe it&#8217;s time to consider legalizing marijuana, as it would likely cripple the cartels.</p> \\n\\n<p>Besides, in areas like Humboldt County and Boulder CO, it already is de facto legal. Prohibition on alcohol didn&#8217;t work in the 1920&#8217;s and instead led to the growth of organized crime.&amp;#160; Our laws against marijuana are now similarly counter-productive.&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s time to change them.</p>',\n",

Yesterday, a group of seven civil rights organizations criticized the education department&#8217;s heavy reliance on competitive grants, saying that the strategy hurts poor and minority children.</p> \\n\\n<p>But, Duncan said, &#8220;Nothing moves people as quickly as the opportunity for more funding &#8211; especially in tough budget times.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The Obama Administration is asking Congress to continue the Race to the Top and Investing in Innovation grant programs next year.</p> \\n\\n<p>The first round of Race to the Top yielded only two winners: Tennessee and Delaware. Illinois placed 5th out of 41 applicants. Duncan said today that this time, far more states will take home the remaining $3.4 billion. &amp;#160; &#8220;[That&#8217;s] enough to fund about 10 to 15 states, depending on whether large or small states win,&#8221; Duncan said.</p> \\n\\n<p>Delaying the bulk of the rewards was a calculated move, he said, to get even more states to make reforms in the second round.</p> \\n\\n<p>Teams from each of the finalist states will travel to Washington, D.C. in August to make the case that their states have the capacity and will to follow through with the pledged reforms. Then, winners will be announced in September.</p> \\n\\n<p>During Illinois&#8217; first application, the state generally performed well in the four federal reform areas, says Darren Reisberg, a deputy superintendent and attorney with the Illinois State Board of Education. But evaluators were less impressed with waning buy-in from school districts.</p> \\n\\n<p>Reisberg says one factor was the rushed Round 1 deadline. Final application forms were given out in October and due in January, leaving little &#8220;face to face&#8221; time to build a unified application.</p> \\n\\n<p>Out of Illinois&#8217; 879 school districts, only 368 signaled support for the first round of Race to the Top. For the second round, however, that number has grown to 524 &#8211; almost 60 percent of the state&#8217;s districts and the vast majority of the state&#8217;s students. &amp;#160; Tim Daly, president of The New Teacher Project, a national authority on teacher recruitment and certification, says that resistance partially is due to logistical concerns from smaller school districts.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that they don&#8217;t want to do these things, they just don&#8217;t have the resources,&#8221; Daly says.</p> \\n\\n<p>Even so, Robin Steans, executive director of the education think tank Advance Illinois, says the state has an excellent chance now because of legislation approved by the General Assembly this year.</p> \\n\\n<p>That includes increasing the number of charter schools and <a href=\"/notebook/index.php/entry/705\" type=\"external\">creating tougher standards for certifying principals</a>, as well as bills that <a href=\"/notebook/index.php/entry/507\" type=\"external\">require school districts to work with their union on teacher evaluation and let non-profits offer alternative teacher certification programs</a>.</p> \\n\\n<p>If Illinois wins, Steans says, the more immediate changes will be investment in new infrastructure and computer technology &#8211; especially Illinois&#8217; longitudinal data system, which will track student performance from preschool through post-secondary education and the workforce. But Duncan said in a conference call after his speech that even the states that don&#8217;t win will benefit from the contest&#8217;s &#8220;consensus-building process&#8221;: Groups that often find themselves at odds managed to find enough common ground to sign on to applications together.</p> \\n\\n<p>Duncan&#8217;s words are likely to draw fire from the increasing number of Race to the Top opponents, including unions irked by the emphasis on charter schools and achievement-based teacher evaluations, as well as others who believe the private sector has an outsized influence on education.</p> \\n\\n<p>Perhaps to allay those fears, Duncan is holding <a href=\"http://www.ed.gov/blog/2010/07/secretary-arne-duncan-to-participate-in-radio-town-hall-meeting-with-nations-teachers/\" type=\"external\">a radio town hall meeting with teachers</a> on Thursday.</p> \\n\\n<p>But in today&#8217;s speech, Duncan kept his tough stance toward failing schools.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Too many schools, including many charter schools, are simply not providing students with an education that prepares them for college and careers,&#8221; Duncan said. &#8220;And they need to change the way they do business &#8211; or go out of business.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>In particular, he targeted inequities in education and outlined steps to combat them:</p> \\n\\n<p>Chase Castle is a Springfield-based writer.</p>',\n",

And they said the contamination covered a wider area than had previously been believed.</p> \\n\\n<p>For the study, financed by the Canadian government, the researchers set out to develop a historical record of the contamination, analyzing sediment dating back about 50 years from six small and shallow lakes north of Fort McMurray, Alberta, the center of the oil sands industry. Layers of the sediment were tested for deposits of <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/wastemin/minimize/factshts/pahs.pdf\" type=\"external\">polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons</a>, or PAHs, groups of chemicals associated with oil that in many cases have <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1469515/%20\" type=\"external\">been found</a> to cause cancer in humans after long-term exposure.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;One of the biggest challenges is that we lacked long-term data,&#8221; said John P.

That research <a href=\"http://environment.alberta.ca/documents/wmdrc_-_final_report_march_7_2011.pdf\" type=\"external\">drew criticism</a> from the government of Alberta and others for failing to provide a historical baseline.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Now we have the smoking gun,&#8221; Professor Smol said.</p> \\n\\n<p>He said he was not surprised that the analysis found a rise in PAH deposits after the industrial development of the oil sands, &#8220;but we needed the data.&#8221; He said he had not entirely expected, however, to observe the effect at the most remote test site, a lake that is about 50 miles to the north.</p> \\n\\n<p>Asked about the study, Adam Sweet, a spokesman for Peter Kent, Canada&#8217;s environment minister, emphasized in an e-mail that with the exception of one lake very close to the oil sands, the levels of contaminants measured by the researchers &#8220;did not exceed Canadian guidelines and were low compared to urban areas.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>He added that an <a href=\"http://www.ec.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&amp;amp;n=D87FA775-1&amp;amp;news=DC1E489F-7A47-4241-96D3-2E37344833B6\" type=\"external\">environmental monitoring program</a> for the region announced last February 2012 was put into effect &#8220;to address the very concerns raised by such studies&#8221; and to &#8220;provide an improved understanding of the long-term cumulative effects of oil sands development.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Earlier research has suggested several different ways that the chemicals could spread. Most oil sand production involve large-scale open-pit mining. The chemicals may become wind-borne when giant excavators dig them up and then deposit them into 400-ton dump trucks.</p> \\n\\n<p>Upgraders at some oil sands projects that separate the oil bitumen from its surrounding sand are believed to emit PAHs. And some scientists believe that vast ponds holding wastewater from that upgrading and from other oil sand processes may be leaking PAHs and other chemicals into downstream bodies of water.</p>',\n",
              " 7673: '<p /> \\n\\n<p>Investment banks such as Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and J.P. Morgan, philanthropies such as the Rockefeller Foundation, politicians such as Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Massachusetts former governor and now Bain Capital Managing Director Deval Patrick, and elite universities such as Harvard have been aggressively promoting Pay for Success (also known as Social Impact Bonds) as a solution to intractable financial and political problems facing public education and other public services. In these schemes investment banks pay for public services to be contracted out to private providers and stand to earn much more money than the cost of the service. For example, Goldman Sachs put up $16.6 million to fund an early childhood education program in Chicago yet it is getting more than $30 million (Sanchez, 2016) from the city. While Pay for Success is only at its early stages in the United States, the Rockefeller Foundation and Merrill Lynch estimate that by 2020, market size for impact investing will reach between $400 billion to $1 trillion (Quinton, 2015). The Every Student Succeeds Act of 2016, the latest iteration of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, directs federal dollars to incentivize these for profit educational endeavors significantly legitimizing and institutionalizing them.</p> \\n\\n<p>Pay for Success is promoted by proponents as an innovative financing technique that brings together social service providers with private funders and non-profit organizations committed to expanding social service provision. In theory, Pay for Success expands accountability because programs are independently evaluated for their success and the government only pays the funder (the bank) if the program meets the metrics. If the program exceeds the metrics, then the investor can receive bonus money making the program much more expensive for the public and highly lucrative for the banks.</p> \\n\\n<p>Banks love Pay for Success because they can profit massively from it and invest money with high returns at a time of a glut of capital and historically low interest rates. Politicians (especially rightist democrats) love Pay for Success because they can claim to be expanding public services without raising taxes or issuing bonds and will only have the public pay for &#8220;what works.&#8221; Elite universities and corporate philanthropies love Pay for Success because they support &#8220;innovation&#8221; and share an ethos that only the prime beneficiaries of the current economy, the rich, can save the poor.</p> \\n\\n<p>Pay for Success began as Social Impact Bonds and were imported into the U.S. from the U.K. around 2010. They were promoted by the leading consultancy advocate of neoliberal education McKinsey Consulting, the neoliberal thinktank, Center for American Progress, that was founded by former Clinton Chief of Staff and Democratic Party leader John Podesta (who also led Obama&#8217;s transition), and the Rockefeller Foundation. Pay for Success expansion is now the central agenda of the Rockefeller Foundation. Shortly before championing Pay for Success for Chicago, Rahm Emanuel served as Obama&#8217;s Chief of Staff, having had a long career as a hard driving Democratic congressman and political money raiser and also an investment banker. Certain other key figures lobbied to expand the use of Pay for Success. Most notably, Jeffrey Liebman went from Obama&#8217;s Office of Management and Budget to a large center at Harvard, the Government Performance Lab in the Kennedy School of Government dedicated to expanding Pay for Success. Liebman is both a leader of the Center for American Progress and was a key economic advisor to Obama in his 2008 campaign. Other key influencers of Pay for Success include The Rockefeller Foundation and Third Sector Capital.</p> \\n\\n<p>Advocates explain that the value of a Pay for Success program is allegedly: 1) it creates a &#8220;market incentive&#8221; for a bank or investor to fund a social program when allegedly there is not the political will to support the expansion of public services; 2) by injecting &#8220;market discipline&#8221; into the bureaucratically encumbered public sector, Pay for Success will make the public sector &#8220;accountable&#8221; through investment in &#8220;what works&#8221; and it will avoid funding public programs for which the public has &#8220;little to show,&#8221; as Liebman and Third Sector Capital Partners are fond of suggesting (Wallace, 2014). The value of any public spending in this view must be measurable through quantitative metrics to be of social value; 3) it consequently saves money by not funding programs that cannot be shown to be effective; 4) it shifts risk away from the public and onto the private sector while retaining only the potential social benefit for the public; 5) and lastly, it mobilizes beneficent corporations, banks, powerful non-profit companies, and philanthropic foundations to save the poor, the powerless, and the public from themselves. Here, Goldman Sachs frames its profit seeking activities as corporate social responsibility, charity, and good works that define its image in the public mind. In fact, all five of these positions that advocates claim explicitly or implicitly to support the expansion of Pay for Success are baseless.</p> \\n\\n<p>The Myths of Pay for Success</p> \\n\\n<p>Myth 1: Market Discipline</p> \\n\\n<p>Repeating a longstanding neoliberal mantra of private sector efficiency and public sector bloat, advocates of Pay for Success claim that the programs are necessary because they inject a healthy dose of market discipline into the bureaucratically encumbered and unaccountable public sphere. According to the leading proponent of Pay for Success, Jeffrey Liebman of the Government Performance Lab of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, private sector finance produces this market discipline because governments do not monitor and measure the services provided by contractors. Liebman says, &#8220;(Government) Programs that don&#8217;t produce results continue to be financed year after year, something that would not happen in the business world&#8221; (Overland, 2011). This is an odd claim from one of Obama&#8217;s leading economic advisors at the time that Obama was sworn in as President and proceeded to have the public sector bail out the private sector. The 2008 financial bailout of the banks by the U.S. federal government represents a repudiation of the neoliberal logic of the natural discipline of markets and of deregulation. The private sector including banks, insurance companies, and the automotive industry needed the public sector to step in and save unprofitable businesses and businesses that had invested in the deregulated mortgage backed securities markets. More broadly, some of the largest sectors of the economy such as defense, agriculture, and entertainment rely on massive public sector subsidies to function. Specifically, the financial crisis and consequent recession was a result first of neoliberal bank deregulation and a faith in markets to regulate themselves but also it demonstrated the illegal activity, fraud, and lies of the same banks that now seek profit through Pay for Success including Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, and J.P. Morgan.</p> \\n\\n<p>Pay for Success proponents claim that the financing scheme is necessary because there would otherwise not be the political will to do projects such as early childhood education in Chicago for a couple of thousand children or recidivism reduction programs in Massachusetts. Third Sector Capital Partners, a non-profit that relies on Pay for Success expansion as a cornerstone of its business, claims that Americans do not support state spending and hence Pay for Success is necessary (Von Glhn and Whistler). However, Gallup shows that 75% of Americans favor expanded public spending on infrastructure (Newport, 2016a) and 58% support replacing the Affordable Care Act with a universal federal healthcare system (Newport, 2016b). Indeed, as longstanding studies and more recently the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign of 2016 indicate, a large percentage of Americans support a range of increased spending on progressive social programs.</p> \\n\\n<p>A mantra found in the literature that advocates Pay for Success is that it &#8220;allow[s] the government to avoid paying for programs that don&#8217;t make a difference&#8221; (Overland). For working class and poor citizens, many of whom are working two and three low paying jobs, the cost of private early childcare and education is a major financial burden. The fact that early childcare and education have become corporatized by national companies who pay super-exploitative wages to workers only worsens the situation. The fact that early childcare and education are vital economic needs raises a question about whose political will is in question when Pay for Success proponents claim that the only way to provide early child educational services is with the involvement of banks, and without banks it should not be provided. The parents and community members are not the ones who lack the political will. Political and financial elites do not want to pay for other people&#8217;s children&#8230; without a cut.</p> \\n\\n<p>Myth 2: Transfer of Risk from the Public to the Private</p> \\n\\n<p>The elaborate involvement of banks, lawyers, profits, and non-profit coordinating companies appears more than superfluous when one takes a closer look at what is actually being done with Pay for Success in Chicago through the expansion of pre-K to 2,600 Chicago Public School children. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel&#8217;s office lists six schools on the west and south sides and reports, &#8220;CPS and its teachers will manage the expanded program in these schools for the current academic year and expand to additional schools in future years&#8221;(Mayor&#8217;s Press Office). If the program simply expands existing CPS programs with already employed teachers and administrators, then the potentially significantly higher cost of using the Pay for Success makes little sense. In other words, why not just expand the existing successful services such as the parent-child centers that had been successful in Chicago since 2002? According to the mayor&#8217;s office, the risk is worth it because Pay for Success &#8220;is structured to insure that its lenders, the Goldman Sachs Social Impact Bond Fund and Northern Trust as senior lenders, and the J.B. and M.K. Pritzker Family Foundation as a subordinate lender, are only repaid if students realize positive academic results&#8221; (Mayor&#8217;s Office). However, critics of Pay for Success point out that in reality there is little risk for investors of losing that $17 million because the investors select already proven projects such as those in Chicago (Sanchez, 2016). Indeed, they are more likely to make the millions more in profit as in the $30 million that Goldman was paid back (Sanchez, 2016). As Melissa Sanchez of Catalyst Chicago points out, investors make not only profits but additionally receive positive public relations, good will, and image boosting (Sanchez). This is not a small matter for a bank such as Goldman Sachs that was in the center of the sub-prime mortgage crisis and was found to have committed both illegal and unethical investment practices.</p> \\n\\n<p>Risk is also mitigated for the banks by philanthropies such as Rockefeller or Bloomberg that guarantee repayment of the money the banks invest (Quinton). Even the proponents admit that Pay for Success is &#8220;not a panacea&#8221; as banks are not really willing to take risks and consequently they are only willing to consider about 20% of service providers (Overland). The attractive service providers are ones with established track records that all but guarantee success. Pay for Success cannot be justified as an innovative scheme that tranfers the risk taking of the market into the public sector while transferring financial risk out of the public sector and onto markets.</p> \\n\\n<p>Economist David Macdonald points out the extent to which the promise of risk transfer is in fact a lie. Macdonald explains that Pay for Success is not experimental. He argues that a bank such as Goldman Sachs is never going to put up $5 million with a 50% risk of losing their money, and so it will invest only in proven projects. Moreover, even if Goldman were to take a risk and the metrics did not pan out in its favor,</p> \\n\\n<p>there&#8217;s no way the government will refuse to pay Goldman Sachs back the full $5 million. Why? Because if Goldman Sachs loses $5 million or any part of it, it&#8217;s not going to come back next year, and neither are any of the other bankers and private investors. (Macdonald, 37)</p> \\n\\n<p>Yet, even with the risk to bank profits eliminated by highly selective program selection, underwriting by philanthropies, and the government&#8217;s desire to keep the bank coming back, as the Chicago example highlights, even if the leveraged Chicago Public Schools go bankrupt as the Republican Investment Banker Governor of Illinois Bruce Rauner seems intent to cause (Joravsky), banks such as Goldman Sachs are first in line as creditors as the pieces of the system are sold off (Joravsky). So rather than a system that injects the risk taking of markets into the public sector, Pay for Success injects capital drainage into successful programs while assuring minimal risk only for the profiteers. As Macdonald writes, the inversion of risk represents a disturbing change in who government serves,</p> \\n\\n<p>People pay their taxes (and expect corporations to do so as well) in part because they want the government to deliver good services to the people who need them. But social impact bonds direct tax dollars to bank profits instead of to people in need. This dramatically changes who is being served by the government: from those who need a helping hand to affluent investors who need no government help at all. (Macdonald)</p> \\n\\n<p>Myth 3: Accountability</p> \\n\\n<p>Proponents also claim Pay for Success programs are more accountable than the public sector because allegedly programs are measured independently. As the principles of Third Sector Capital write, &#8220;Outcomes need to be tangible and measurable, such as reduced recidivism rates and lower utilization of foster care placement. The analyses of fiscal savings need to be demonstrated in quantifiable numbers, such as a reduction in special education dollars, lower Medicare payouts and lower juvenile justice expenditures&#8221; (Von Glahn and Whistler, 22).</p> \\n\\n<p>Yet critics of Pay for Success have raised issues about who is making the decisions about measurement and how benchmarks have been decided (Overland, 5). A basic problem with this argument for accountability through measurable outcomes is that, in practice, as a juvenile justice caseworker involved in a recidivism reduction Massachusetts Pay for Success project explained to me, s/he received constant phone calls from an investment bank encouraging him/her to have the metrics turn out in the favor of the bank so that the bank would earn the maximum amount possible through the bond. Indeed, what I heard directly from a participant in a Pay for Success was a general concern of Jon Pratt, head of the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits. Pratt stated, &#8220;You&#8217;re definitely creating incentives that would be considered corruption pressures.&#8221; Pratt&#8217;s point is that by having allegedly independent measurement tied to the possibility of profit or loss, a not so independent incentive is created to game the outcomes or cheat.</p> \\n\\n<p>Such &#8220;corruption pressures&#8221; in neoliberal education reform have had a high profile as high stakes standardized testing threatened to defund school districts, schools, and classrooms if test scores did not rise. Administrators and teachers, deeply concerned that poor students would lose desperately needed resources, found that the ethical action would be to cheat rather that participate in sanctifying the denial of resources to those most in need. Similarly, when the largest for profit educational management company, Edison Schools (now Edison Learning), was expanding in the 1990&#8217;s and 2000&#8217;s, their increased growth depended upon continually raising more investor capital. The for-profit education company could only acquire capital by showing prospective investors increasingly rising test scores (Saltman, 2005). As a consequence, numerous test scandals erupted and massive institutional pressure was placed on administrators and teachers to show raised test scores no matter what.</p> \\n\\n<p>Other critics raise practical concerns with Pay for Success, including concern that organizational capacity of a service provider can be temporarily built up by a contract but &#8220;not build the organizations&#8217; capacity to support that growth&#8221; (Wallace, 4). As well, critics point to how time-consuming these agreements are to create (Wallace, 4). Contracts are so convoluted and complicated that what normally would take a month to do takes two years and with financial arrangements so complicated that a university professor in financial management &#8220;still needed help understanding the financing&#8221; (Farmer).</p> \\n\\n<p>In Chicago&#8217;s Pay for Success early childhood project, as the commissioned evaluation report makes clear, not only had this particular project received positive evaluations since 2002, but early childhood education interventions such as this Child Parent Center model have been measured and found to have positive effects on future academic performance since 1967 (Gaylor, 16). Unsurprisingly, that is, early childhood learning initiatives have been known to result in measurable improvements in student performance in subsequent academic years. These facts raise obvious questions as to Pay for Success advocates&#8217; claims that private bank financing is needed to assure measurable accountability.</p> \\n\\n<p>An additional problem with accountability being understood strictly through numerically quantifiable measurement is that the problems of positivist ideology are brought into areas of educational service that are not necessary ideally measurable in quantitative terms. Positivist ideology treats knowledge and truth as a collection of facts and radically devalues examination of the theoretical assumptions behind claims to truth (Giroux). Knowledge in this view disregards both the relationship between learning and the interpretive practices and perspectives of subjects as well as the relationship between learning and the broader social world. As Pay for Success projects receive that $400 billion to $1 trillion, they will be used for a wider array of educational services including many areas of schooling in which learning is interpretive and involves judgment, criticism, and analysis. Not necessarily always quantifiable, the development of such interpretive capacities do not always appear immediately but progress over time. The message from the leaders of Pay for Success is that the government spends billions of dollars on public services that are not measured and hence has &#8220;little to show for it&#8221; (Wallace, 2). Implicit here is an assumption that that which cannot be immediately measured quantifiably also cannot be justified as a public expense. This presumes that the kinds of subjects that are less quantifiably measured such as the humanities or abstract sciences are less valuable and that funding in the future ought only to follow that which can be quantified.</p> \\n\\n<p>The denial of interests and values renders the measurement fetish of accountability pseudo-science or scientism. For example, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and Bank of America have all been seeking profit in Pay for Success. Each bank has paid the U.S. Department of Justice multi-billion dollar settlements for not prosecuting them for lying about the risks of subprime mortgage investments and defrauding investors in the run up to the 2008 subprime crisis and great recession (Shen, 2016). In 2011 confessed financial fraudster Goldman Sachs sought 22% profit on its investment of $9.6 million in a Riker&#8217;s Island Pay for Success project teaching moral reasoning to juvenile inmates (Quinton). The efficacy of the project was to be measured by reducing recidivism. Shortly after lying and breaking the law for profit, Goldman Sachs received a contract from New York City&#8217;s billionaire Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Bloomberg&#8217;s own philanthropy backed the Goldman Sachs investment so that, should the metrics not pan out, the bank would not lose money. While this particular Pay for Success project did not achieve the metrics, the value of the metrics themselves as an arbiter of the value of the project are profoundly suspect in that they shut down some of the most crucial questions that need to be asked of such a project like: Why would a company responsible for tanking the economy through fraud be hired to teach moral reasoning to youth?; Why are the youth incarcerated in the first place and what class and race position do they come from?; Why did none of the leaders of Goldman Sachs or the other banks who broke the law in the financial crisis spend a day in prison and what class and race positions do they come from?; What are the broader structural and systemic patterns and power relations that produce these different lived realities of legal accountability for some and no accountability for others like the ways that a racialized class hierarchy is reproduced through mass incarceration, the finance industry, and the educational system?; Who is authorized to develop the metrics, what is their expertise, what are their interests, and how do they assess the rules they set in place?; To whom are those legislating the accountability measurements accountable? The scientism of metrics obscures these kinds of questions. Accountability should be a part of educational projects but not through restricted metrics that conceal the broader politics informing the project. Rather, accountability should be in a form in which knowledge is comprehended in relation to how subjectivity is formed through broader social forces and in ways in which learning can form the basis for collective action to expand egalitarian and just social relations.</p> \\n\\n<p>Myth 4: Cost Savings</p> \\n\\n<p>A central argument of Pay for Success proponents is that they save money by only funding successful programs. However, as the prior sections suggest, if in fact evaluation is not independent and only already successful programs are being selected, and governments have incentives to continue contracting, and there are &#8220;corruption pressures,&#8221; then the alleged &#8220;market discipline&#8221; through competition cannot work. Yet, there is additional evidence that Pay for Success adds costs rather than cutting them.</p> \\n\\n<p>Pay for Success introduces large expenses to fund extensive legal services to handle those convoluted and complicated contracts that take years instead of months (Sanchez 2014). Additionally, third party project managers and evaluators add costs to the services (Sanchez 2014). If the metrics pan out for the investors, then they can earn more than double the money that they put up for the service (Sanchez, 2014, p. 2). The intensely time-consuming and convoluted deals cost more money for administration, and this cuts into the spending on the service itself (Wallace, 2014). The Department of Legislative Services in Maryland studied Social Impact Bonds for recidivism reduction programs and found no savings (Wallace, 5). For prisons or schools with fixed costs such as physical sites, saving in per inmate or student cost is not significant because it does not reduce the fixed costs (Wallace, 5).</p> \\n\\n<p>On the west side of Chicago, one of the billionaire heir&#8217;s to the Hyatt hotel fortune, J.B. Pritzger, whose investment firm worked with Goldman Sachs on the Chicago early childhood Pay for Success project, cut the ribbon at an early childhood center and stated that such projects must be good investments to be successful (Wallace, 6). Pritzger&#8217;s statement aligns with a trend that has intensified since the advent of venture philanthropy reimagined philanthropy as being similar to business (Saltman). Venture philanthropies hijack public governance, install corporate models and managerialism for public services, and promote public sector privatization by steering the use of public money towards the private sector (Saltman). Venture philanthropies generally give money and the giving results in a tax break for the corporation or individual that gives to the non-profit. However, most venture philanthropies do not actually seek to get the money back, let alone with profit. Social Impact Bonds (aka Pay for Success), according to David Macdonald, are not philanthropy; they are, rather, &#8220;anti-philanthropy.&#8221;(Macdonald, 1) They are profit-seeking activity masquerading as philanthropy. Some venture philanthropy has a similar effect, such as when Gates and Microsoft privatize public education by the initiatives of the Gates Foundation for privatization schemes, technology dependency and so on. However, not even venture philanthropy is explicitly organized as a for profit business. Pay for Success is similar to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative launched in 2015 in which the &#8220;philanthropy&#8221; is actually a limited liability corporation that financially invests in other projects. As Macdonald suggests, why not cut out the &#8220;middleman&#8221;? That is, why not cut out the banks seeking profit and the third parties and lawyers facilitating the deals.</p> \\n\\n<p>Finally, a cost problem with Pay for Success is that, as critics contend, with private sector lenders involved, interest rates will tend to be higher than with public sector bond issuance. House Appropriations Committee Chair Representative Ross Hunter blocked a federal Social Impact Bond bill. He said, &#8220;As a private investor, what kind of interest rate are you going to ask for? Eleven percent? Nine percent? By contrast, interest rates on revenue bonds can be as low as 4%. If early learning is a good idea, I can issue [government-backed revenue] bonds to pay for it&#8221; (Hoback). In Chicago, Goldman Sachs&#8217; could more than double their initial investment of $16.6 million (Sanchez 2016) as the metrics determine that Goldman receives the maximum amount from the city under the agreement. This is a much higher total cost to the public to provide the service to 2600 children than what a bond issuance would be.</p> \\n\\n<p>Myth 5: Corporate Social Responsibility</p> \\n\\n<p>In order for banks, corporate foundations, and venture philanthropies to claim that Pay for Success represents the good will of these actors, they must represent public sector pillage as public sector support and care. However, they must also position these private accumulation projects as necessary, inevitable, and without alternative. This is why proponents repeat the private sector language about the &#8220;hopelessly bureaucratic public sector&#8221; needing &#8220;market discipline,&#8221; private sector &#8220;cost savings,&#8221; &#8220;accountability,&#8221; &#8220;financial innovation,&#8221; and &#8220;risk reduction&#8221; despite evidence and reason to the contrary. The private sector project of Pay for Success is not merely one that involves the private capture of public wealth but also the public reframing of symbolic meanings that make such wealth capture possible, remaking common sense in ways that suggest that only the rich can promote just social change by pursuing their financial interests. Such ideologies suggest that the very private forces responsible for draining and weakening the public are in fact saviors for the public, that there is no alternative to markets in every social realm, that public citizens are nothing more than economic actors, and that these projects are apolitical rather than representing the interests and perspectives of capitalists over workers and most citizens. Non-profits such as the Center for American Progress, the Rockefeller Foundation, and Harvard are among the loudest boosters of Pay for Success. The ideological work that these organizations do shapes public perceptions about the morality and public impact of private sector organizations like Goldman Sachs. In this sense, Pay for Success is a form of public relations for banks that the banks largely do not have to pay for. In fact, Pay for Success facilitates banks being paid by the public to promote this public relations bonanza. As with venture philanthropies, the public ends up not only financially subsidizing private banks but also subsidizing the loss of public control over public governance for public services. With venture philanthropies, the subsidy takes public revenues in the form of tax breaks for rich donors and corporations. With Pay for Success, the public pays a premium for services that could have been provided directly through the government and loses democratic governance control over the service.</p> \\n\\n<p>Conclusion</p> \\n\\n<p>Pay for Success/ Social Impact Bonds appeal to banks for their capacity to generate profits from public tax money for education, juvenile justice, and other services and they represent a form of economic redistribution from desperately needed public money for the most vulnerable citizens such as poor youth to business.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; They also appeal to banks who have gotten caught defrauding investors and that can now promote themselves as doing good works while turning a profit. Pay for Success also appeals to neoliberal politicians such as Mayor Emanuel in Chicago who can claim they are doing &#8220;innovative finance&#8221; in the interest of taxpayers instead of raising taxes or issuing educational bonds. The reality is that politicians like Emanuel are just kicking the can down the road as Pay for Success does not solve the historical failure to adequately fund public education or other social services (like the mental health services he gutted), just adding to the longstanding debt burden. In fact, because it costs more, Social Impact investing raises this debt burden while delaying it, thereby destabilizing the public system further. In this sense, Pay for Success is an elaborate form of public relations that makes a failure to address a public problem look like innovative action.</p> \\n\\n<p>Pay for Success/Social Impact Bonds ought to be understood as simply one of the latest efforts of the private sector to exploit and to pillage the public sector for profit at a historical moment of uncertain economic growth and a crisis of capital accumulation. New legislation and policy must be developed to limit the access of investment banks to determining, running, and profiting from social programs.</p> \\n\\n<p>References</p> \\n\\n<p>Chandler, D.

              " 7678: '<p>President Barack Obama\\'s proposed NSA reforms won at least grudging praise from proponents and opponents of the nation&#8217;s broad surveillance program after his speech on Friday.</p> \\n\\n<p>Obama and the data-gathering program have endured criticism from a handful of libertarian-minded conservatives on Capitol Hill. Yet the president\\'s speech -- at first glance -- appeared to strike a balance between civil liberties-minded and national security-oriented lawmakers alike. His proposals included changing the way massive amounts of telephone data is stored as well as increased judicial oversight over how that information is accessed by the government.</p> \\n\\n<p>The speech won a thumbs up from top Democrats who have been particularly critical of the NSA&#8217;s past practices.</p> \\n\\n<p>In a joint statement, Democratic Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon, Mark Udall of Colorado and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico called the president&#8217;s directive to end bulk collection of phone records &#8220;a major milestone&#8221; and &#8220;vindication&#8221; for privacy rights activists.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Ending this dragnet collection will go a long way toward restoring Americans&#8217; constitutional rights and rebuilding the public&#8217;s trust,\" a trio of Democrats said.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;After the long push to rein in overbroad surveillance powers, we are very pleased that the President announced his intent to end the bulk collection of Americans&#8217; phone records,&#8221; the trio said. &#8220;Ending this dragnet collection will go a long way toward restoring Americans&#8217; constitutional rights and rebuilding the public&#8217;s trust.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The group added that they will keep pushing for additional reforms, like reforms to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance court process and protections for American IT companies.</p> \\n\\n<p>In a joint statement, the Democratic and Republican chairs of Senate and House intelligence panels lauded Obama for a \"strong\" speech. And they urged <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Obama</a> to send legislation to Congress mapping out the changes to storage of meta-data.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"If instituted, that approval process must be made faster in the future than it was in the past-when it took up to nine days to gain Court approval for a single search,\" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., said in a joint statement. \"We encourage the White House to send legislation with the president\\'s proposed changes to Congress so they can be fully debated.\"</p> \\n\\n<p>Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy, the powerful chief of the Senate Judiciary Committee, called for similar legislative reforms but praised the president&#8217;s rejection of the existing surveillance program.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;I am encouraged that the president has embraced the growing consensus that the [NSA] phone records program should not continue in its current form. The bulk collection of Americans&#8217; phone records has not made us safer,&#8221; he said.</p> \\n\\n<p>California Democrat Adam Schiff, a member of the House Intelligence Committee who has sponsored legislation to reform the NSA, said the burden is now on Congress to implement reforms to maintain citizens&#8217; privacy.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Though the steps announced today are important, it will be up to Congress to implement many of these changes, as well as others, and to ensure that they are durable across future Administrations,&#8221; he said.</p> \\n\\n<p>And Republicans also largely gave Obama a pass for his proposed reforms.</p> \\n\\n<p>Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., a strong supporter of the surveillance programs, wrote on Twitter: \"Pres Obama NSA speech better than expected. Most programs left intact. But concerned about extending US citizen privacy rights to foreigners\"</p> \\n\\n<p>\"I look forward to learning more about how the new procedure for accessing data will not put Americans at greater risk,\" John Boehner said.</p> \\n\\n<p>Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain voiced concerns that Obama\\'s speech \"left many crucial questions unanswered,\" and called for establishing a Senate select committee to parse through national security and intelligence issues. But he largely spared Obama from any specific critique.</p> \\n\\n<p>Republican leaders in both chambers of Congress -- Speaker John Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell -- were largely muted in the speech\\'s aftermath. Boehner said Obama had \"failed\" to adequately make the case for monitoring programs, but said he would wait to see details of the proposal.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"I look forward to learning more about how the new procedure for accessing data will not put Americans at greater risk,\" the speaker said in a statement. \"And the House will review any legislative reforms proposed by the administration, but we will not erode the operational integrity of critical programs that have helped keep America safe.\"</p> \\n\\n<p>Criticism from Republicans came from familiar voices -- libertarian-minded conservatives who have been consistently-critical of Obama and the national security apparatus.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"President Obama\\'s announced solution to the NSA spying controversy is the same unconstitutional program with a new configuration,\" Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul said in a statement.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"Nothing the President said today will end the unconstitutional invasion of Americans\\' privacy,\" said Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, a Republican acolyte of Paul\\'s libertarianism.</p>',\n",
              " 7680: '<p>There&#8217;s a popular new game among veterans of the immigration debate this week. All you have to do to win is figure out Donald Trump&#8217;s plan for undocumented immigrants.</p> \\n\\n<p>No one has won yet.</p> \\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s not for lack of trying: Reporters, activists, and politicians from across the ideological spectrum have pored over Trump&#8217;s recent comments like Talmudic scholars, looking for a magic word that might explain what he would do with the nation&#8217;s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants.</p> \\n\\n<p>Until recently it was assumed his position was the same as it was throughout the primaries: Deport them all, no exceptions. Last weekend, though, his campaign signaled a new <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">\"to be determined\"</a> position that may or may not let some remain. Since then, Trump has struggled to articulate what that position is, leaving immigration observers scrambling for clues on one of his top issues.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"Right now, clarity seems to be an impossible hurdle for Donald Trump,\" Ali Noorani, executive director of the pro-reform National Immigration Forum Action Fund, said.</p> \\n\\n<p>During prior immigration debates, politicians chose their language with extreme precision because the <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/the-super-complicated-rubio-cruz-immigration-fight-explained\" type=\"external\">slightest shift in language</a> might signal a new stance.</p> \\n\\n<p>This time, though, immigration wonks are confronted with a candidate who seems to have little familiarity with existing policy and is willing to negotiate his own position aloud in real time.</p> \\n\\n<p>On Tuesday, Trump at a Fox News town hall floated at a possible solution in which undocumented immigrants without a criminal record might pay \"back taxes\" and go through a \"process\" rather than being rounded up and deported, although they would receive \"no citizenship.\" He even stopped to poll the audience whether those immigrants should stay, with inconclusive results.</p> \\n\\n<p>That sounded an awful lot like prior Republican compromises on immigration, including one high-profile effort from Jeb Bush. But it was also far short of anything resembling a clear policy.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"We had to focus on a particular phrase because, you know, he is running for president,\" Noorani said. \"And, I have been led to believe people who run for president measure their words carefully. But in the full context of what he says, it is really hard to tell what is serious policy and what is a sales pitch.\"</p> \\n\\n<p>Sure enough, on Thursday, Trump issued another round of confusing statements <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/25/politics/trump-no-legal-status-for-undocumented-immigrants/\" type=\"external\">to CNN&#8217;s Anderson Cooper</a>.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"No legalization,\" Trump said. But he also seemed to open the door to a possible route forward if they left the country first.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"If somebody wants to go legalization route, what they\\'ll do is they\\'ll go, leave the country, hopefully come back in and then we can talk,\" Trump added.</p> \\n\\n<p>That sounded like, as Trump put it in the same interview, a \"hardening\" of his position. But a number of wonks across the spectrum also suggested that Trump, given his new discomfort with deporting longtime residents, might be referring to prior immigration reform proposals that contained a \"touchback\" provision.</p> \\n\\n<p>Under these plans, undocumented immigrants would briefly leave the country as a symbolic gesture, and then return on a path to legal status.</p> \\n\\n<p>Politico&#8217;s Seung Min Kim noted that Trump&#8217;s running mate Mike Pence <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seungminkim/status/768932507513450501\" type=\"external\">proposed just such a plan</a> in 2006. But then, Trump&#8217;s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway had told CNN \"no touchback\" the other night when asked about the idea.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"Head. Hurts,\" Kim <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seungminkim/status/768928080110972928\" type=\"external\">tweeted</a>.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"No idea what this means,\" Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist active in immigration politics, responded.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"Your error was in assuming this campaign acknowledged the accepted meaning of words,\" added Dara Lind, a former policy aide at America&#8217;s Voice and current immigration reporter at Vox.</p> \\n\\n<p>Adding to the confusion, Trump also told Cooper that he would \"go with the laws that are existing,\" which prompted the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/08/26/trumps-position-on-deportations-is-perfectly-clear-let-us-decode-it-for-you/?utm_term=.3670de38b7cb\" type=\"external\">Washington Post&#8217;s Greg Sargent</a> to speculate Trump would prioritize deporting criminals (\"the bad ones,\" as Trump calls them) but offer no relief to anyone else.</p> \\n\\n<p>But that analysis rested on the unproven assumption Trump realized immigrants who entered the country illegally are barred for years from applying for a visa under current law, sometimes permanently. Maybe he would take executive action to allow them to stay instead? Could he do that after demanding President Obama lift his own executive orders shielding undocumented immigrants from deportation?</p> \\n\\n<p>The view was just as muddy for immigration hardliners supportive of Trump&#8217;s prior calls to deport undocumented immigrants without exception.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"I would love to hear verification on his immigration policy,\" Congressman Steve King of Iowa told MSNBC on Friday. \"He said there was \\'softening\\' and now some say that it\\'s a \\'hardening.\\'\"</p> \\n\\n<p>Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors lower levels of immigration, offered a digital shrug on Friday as he watched fellow conservatives debate the \"touchback\" theory.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"He\\'s had more than a year to decide what he thinks about his signature issue,\" Krikorian <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarkSKrikorian/status/769018149861810177\" type=\"external\">tweeted</a>.</p> \\n\\n<p>Ann Coulter, who is promoting a new book called \"In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome,\" accused Trump of allowing pro-reform allies to push him in their direction.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"Whoever gave Trump the legerdemain about \\'back taxes\\' and \\'no citizenship\\' needs to go back to the Rubio campaign,\" Coulter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnnCoulter/status/769207178297237504\" type=\"external\">tweeted</a> on Friday.</p> \\n\\n<p>Sarah Palin, another Trump supporter, told the <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/08/25/sarah-palin-warns-of-massive-disappointment-if-donald-trump-eases-immigration-policy/\" type=\"external\">Wall Street Journal</a> that Trump would face \"massive disappointment\" from his fans if went \"wishy-washy\" on immigration.</p> \\n\\n<p>There may not be a way for Trump to clarify his position to everyone&#8217;s satisfaction. Noorani, with the National Immigration Forum, suggested a written statement.</p> \\n\\n<p>But Trump already issued one immigration white paper last year that left things vague on deportations and one that he <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">has contradicted repeatedly</a>. Trump recently abandoned a detailed tax plan he released during the primaries as well in favor of a new proposal.</p> \\n\\n<p>While some pro-reform Republicans have mockingly invited Trump into their fold this week, Bush has learned better than to make any bold pronouncements after spending an entire campaign debating against Trump.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"I can only say that whatever his views are this morning, they might change this afternoon, and they were different than they were last night, and they\\'ll be different tomorrow,\" he said in an <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/jeb-bush-trump-immigration-morphing-227418#ixzz4ITPv5hl1\" type=\"external\">interview</a> on WABC.</p>',\n",

A substantial proportion of the cases occurred in children age ten years or less, a population in which hallucinations are not common, the authors said.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;The occurrence of such symptoms in young children,&#8221; they wrote, &#8220;may be particularly traumatic and undesirable, both to the child and the parents.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;The predominance in young children of hallucinations, both visual and tactile,&#8221; it stated, &#8220;involving insects, snakes and worms is striking, and deserves further evaluation.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>But the fact that these drugs cause psychosis is not news. The rate of psychotic events was reported in a 5-year Canadian study of children diagnosed with ADHD, by Cherland and Fitzpatrick in 1999. Among the 192 children studied, 98 had been placed on stimulant drugs, mostly methylphenidate, and psychotic symptoms developed in more than 9% of the children and ceased as soon as the medication was stopped.</p> \\n\\n<p>Researchers reported no psychotic symptoms in children who did not receive stimulants and the authors noted that due to poor reporting, the rate of drug induced psychosis and psychotic symptoms was probably much higher.</p> \\n\\n<p>Dr Chris Griffith testified at the March 26, 2006, hearing on behalf of the industry funded front group, known as CHADD, and as much as said, kids would burn in hell without ADHD drugs. &#8220;What happens when a child loses all hope and ambition;&#8221; she asked the panel, &#8220;what happens when it is easier to find a vial of crack cocaine or 40 ounces of beer as opposed to a park or community recreation center?&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>According to psychiatrist, Dr Stefan Kruszewski, the opposite is true. &#8220;Children who are medicated early,&#8221; he says, &#8220;do not learn to develop coping strategies that work as they move through different developmental stages.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Instead,&#8221; he says, &#8220;they learn to rely on drugs to solve problems, rather than their creative potential to solve problems on their own or with the help of family, friends, schooling, music and the arts, church, social outings, recreation and sports.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Dr Griffith also asked the advisory panel to think about:</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;What happens to a future generation of minority youth, African-American, Latino males who disproportionately populate our juvenile justice system? What happens to a teenager&#8217;s sense of fun when we are dealing with high rates of teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases and even abortions?</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Finally, what does it say about all of us? We turn on the news each night and we tragically see young drivers, teenagers, killed in automobile accidents&#8211;so many that we forget their names, their faces and their stories. We develop a sense of apathy.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;This may all seem like drama,&#8221; she stated, but &#8220;it is the untold story of what happens when we fail to recognize and treat ADHD.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>According to Dr Griffith, depriving kids of legalized speed leads to every sin known to man. &#8220;With untreated ADHD,&#8221; she told the panel, &#8220;we see higher rates of school and occupational failure; greater rates of incarceration; juvenile delinquency; substance abuse; teen pregnancy; sexually transmitted diseases; more problems with depression and self esteem and, finally, greater numbers of automobile accidents and fatalities.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>This is a drama all right, but it&#8217;s the other way around. A study in the February 2006, Journal of Drug and Alcohol Dependence, examined data from a 2002 survey of about 67,000 households, and reported that more than 7 million Americans have misused ADHD stimulant drugs, and &#8220;substantial numbers of teenagers and young adults appear to show signs of addiction, according to a comprehensive national analysis tracking such abuse.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The researchers found that in one 12-month period, about 1.6 million teens and young adults had misused the drugs and that 75,000 showed signs of addiction.</p> \\n\\n<p>In addition, for years there have been reports of suicide and violence in persons on ADHD drugs. For example, back on January 30, 1999, Adderall use resulted in the death of 5-week-old, Tyra Ehlis, in Grand Forks, North Dakota, when Ron Ehlis killed his daughter ten days after his doctor wrote the a prescription for Adderall.</p> \\n\\n<p>In this case, Ron had been on Ritalin as a child, and when he went to a psychiatrist at age 26, because he was having difficulties with his college studies, without conducting any tests whatsoever, the doctor prescribed Adderall.</p> \\n\\n<p>A few days later, Ron doubled the dose per his doctor&#8217;s instructions, and he began experiencing delusions, hallucinations, and out-of-body experiences, including talks with God and his dead grandfather.</p> \\n\\n<p>Shortly thereafter, acting under a belief that he was carrying out God&#8217;s orders, Ron shot Tyra, and then himself in the stomach, but he survived.</p> \\n\\n<p>Ron went on trial for the murder of his daughter, but the charges were dismissed after several doctors testified that Ron suffered from an Adderall-induced psychosis. The infant&#8217;s mother also testified that Ron had not acted like himself from the first day that he began taking the Adderall.</p> \\n\\n<p>Adderall also caused the violent death of 8-year-old, Jessica Curry, in Spokane, Washington. In late September 1999, she was a happy little third-grader sitting on her mother&#8217;s lap in a Mustang convertible telling mom what she wanted to wear for Halloween.</p> \\n\\n<p>After saying she wanted to be a princess, Jessica&#8217;s mother, who was on Adderall at the time, stabbed her daughter 5 times and then stabbed herself. Here too, the mother lived but child did not. A short time later, a policeman came across mother and daughter still sitting in car in the driveway all covered in blood.</p> \\n\\n<p>Jessica&#8217;s mother was also found not guilty by reason of insanity brought on by the Adderall after doctors for the prosecution and the defense agreed that her mental state was so acute that she could not have distinguished right from wrong at the time that she killed her daughter.</p> \\n\\n<p>The death of 3-year-old Nathaniel Branson must also be classified as an Adderall fatality. On March 18, 2000, Nat&#8217;s mother Dawn was driving in Scottsdale, Arizona with her son in the car when she suffered a psychotic episode while under the influence of Adderall.</p> \\n\\n<p>According to court documents, Dawn heard a voice saying: &#8220;Let go of the steering wheel and gas. God will drive the car don&#8217;t you trust him?&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Dawn did as she was told and a car accident caused the death of her son and serious injuries to herself. She had never been psychotic before taking Adderall and she has had no more psychotic episodes since she quit taking the drug.</p> \\n\\n<p>So when the FDA reported that the agency had received hundreds of reports of aggressive behavior in children taking ADHD drugs, and up to 20% resulted in a significant injury or hospitalization, this was not news either.</p> \\n\\n<p>Experts say to expect more of the same as the prescriptions for these drugs continue to multiply. At the advisory meeting, Dr Gelperin noted the expansion of the customer base stating: &#8220;Drug treatment of ADHD is increasing in all age groups &#8230; and also drug treatment for ADHD can now potentially be life-long.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>It hard to imagine how sales could go higher. In 2005, according to Research and Markets, the value of the ADHD market was $2.6 billion and is now the 9th largest segment of the CNS market by sales with growth of 8% year-on-year.</p> \\n\\n<p>Attorney, Barry Turner, a lecturer in law and medical ethics at Leeds Law School in the UK, warns about of dangers of &#8220;pathologising&#8221; children&#8217;s behavior. He says psychiatric drugs have a disinhibitory effect on children and those who grow up disinhibited become psychopathic.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Psychopaths,&#8221; he explains, &#8220;are unable to benefit from guilt, fear or empathy and pray on victims without inhibition.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;ADHD drugs are creating a generation of psychopaths,&#8221; he warns, &#8220;not because it is real, but because children are being brainwashed into believing they are sick.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;It becomes a self fulfilling prophecy,&#8221; Mr Turner says.</p> \\n\\n<p>By disrupting the brain development of small children, he explains, drug makers are manufacturing a small army of &#8220;artificial psychopaths.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>When testifying at the hearing, FDA scientist, Dr Mosholder, told the advisors what all parents deserve to know. &#8220;There are no pathognomonic physical or laboratory findings,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and there is no psychological testing that can make the diagnosis for certain.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The panel was informed that children are being stigmatized for life by being wrongfully diagnosed and put on drugs. Sue Parry, a school-based occupational therapist from New Mexico, testified that parents are not aware of the future harm that may result from an ADHD diagnosis, as described by Dr William Carey who states:</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;The label may be stigmatizing and harmful in the long term in ways that are only dimply appreciated today. The diagnosis of brain malfunction, which seems so useful and comforting today, may at a later time come back to plague the person.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;We have not yet had sufficient time to observe fully the possible consequences it may have for education opportunities, employment, the military service or security clearances. Labels stick firmly, especially when they involve neurological disability.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Allen Jones, speaking on behalf of the Alliance for Human Research Protection, told the advisors that the FDA should instruct the pharmaceutical industry to advise the FDA of all adverse events that have been reported on the drugs immediately, and demand that all clinical trials be turned over so that independent researchers can review them.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have the luxury of time to wait for the future trials,&#8221; he said, &#8220;children are dying.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Having lost her son to the side effects of Zyprexa before a warning was added to its label, Ellen Liversridge, testified on behalf of parents who lost children. &#8220;I grieve particularly today,&#8221; she said, &#8220;for the 51 dead of ADHD drugs that were announced by the FDA.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;I guess my up-front message, front and center,&#8221; she told the panel, &#8220;is that you know that these drugs can cause serious side effects and death, including sudden death, hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, and possibly bipolar disorder.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;This being the case,&#8221; she stated, &#8220;I urge you to recommend that these drugs have an appropriate black box warning placed on the label starting immediately.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>A grieving mother, Jacqueline Bessner, told the story of her 15-year-old daughter, Leanne, a high school sophomore who she said, was popular, beautiful, acted in school plays, loved sports, played baseball, and was on the varsity basketball team.</p> \\n\\n<p>Ms Bessner informed the panel that Leanne &#8220;will not run another base, or shoot another free throw or tease her little sister, or share memories with her own children because on October 9th 2005, she took her life.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>This family&#8217;s nightmare began when Leanne complained to her mother about problems concentrating and she took Leanne to a counselor, who diagnosed her with ADD and sent a recommendation to their family doctor to prescribe Concerta.</p> \\n\\n<p>On September 18, 2005, the doctor doubled the dose after Leanne told her mother she was not feeling any better, and 3 weeks later, Ms Bessner found her daughter hanging from a loft bed with a belt around her neck in her bedroom.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Amongst my screams,&#8221; she told the panel, &#8220;I recall her beautiful brown eyes partially open.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The family has retained the Conshohocken, Pennsylvania-based law firm of, Pogust &amp;amp; Braslow, for the purpose of bringing a wrongful death claim against the manufacturer of Concerta, and attorney, Derek Braslow attended the hearings with Leeane&#8217;s parents.</p> \\n\\n<p>Mr Braslow says, &#8220;Leeane&#8217;s story should be required reading for every pediatrician and child psychiatrist in the country.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>According to WebMed on March 26, 2006, Dr Tom Laughren, head of the FDA&#8217;s division of psychiatric products, said, the committee appeared &#8220;unimpressed&#8221; by more than 350 reports of suicidal thoughts or behaviors in treated children over the last five years.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Up to 20% of middle and high school students,&#8221; he stated, &#8220;already report such thoughts, and it was unclear that drugs other than Strattera led to increased risk.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Any street addict knows that crashing after taking amphetamines brings on the most severe depression, in large part, experts says, because speed almost always disrupts the appetite and sleep cycle. However, unwitting consumers of ADHD drugs would have no way of knowing this if they start feeling suicidal when they cannot eat or sleep as the speed wears.</p> \\n\\n<p>According to Attorney Braslow, &#8220;Dr Laughren&#8217;s comments are offensive and lack sympathy for those families in grief.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>He points out that Leeane was not on Strattera, she was on Concerta, and she was not depressed or suicidal before she began taking the drug. &#8220;These drugs take the life out of children,&#8221; he said.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;They do one of two things to children and teenagers,&#8221; Mr Braslow explains, &#8220;turn them into zombies, making them passive and non-responsive or as they affected Leeane &#8211; turn them into hyperfocused, anxious kids who can&#8217;t sleep and who become consumed with minor typical teen issues like friendships, boyfriends and school.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt that these drugs may help some adolescents or children,&#8221; he notes. &#8220;But at what price?&#8221; he states, &#8220;Better grades? Quieter class rooms?&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;The FDA has finally admitted that these drugs can cause sudden death, serious cardiovascular events, hallucinations, psychosis, suicidality, mania and suppression of growth among others,&#8221; he says, &#8220;but these warnings come too late for Leeane and her family.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>And Mr Braslow points out that despite the new warnings, physicians continue to prescribe ADHD drugs in record numbers.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;These warnings are worthless,&#8221; he says, &#8220;unless first, doctors inform families of the risks, so families can make informed decisions about these drugs and so they can look out for signs of suicidality or psychosis and second, doctors stop giving these drugs out like candy, stop giving samples of these drugs to families based upon the whim of a teacher or nurse.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Mr Braslow says, &#8220;doctors need to actually weigh the risks and benefits of these drugs before recommending them.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;While the newest warnings on these drugs are certainly necessary,&#8221; he notes, &#8220;albeit many years late, these warnings still are not strong enough to adequately inform physicians about the true risks of these drugs.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;The FDA advisory committees,&#8221; he states, &#8220;should stop worrying about frightening doctors with valid warnings and start giving doctors all the warnings so they can make fully informed choices.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;That is the job of the FDA,&#8221; he states. &#8220;Our children deserve better.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The number of ADHD related deaths cited at the hearing does not reflect an accurate picture. There are many more deaths recorded in the individual states. For instance, according to the report, &#8220;Child Suicides In Florida Associated With Use Of Psychotropic Drugs,&#8221; by Ken Kramer, of the 252 cases of suicide in children under 18, between 2000 and 2004, thirty-six were on ADHD drugs.</p> \\n\\n<p>Because the FDA system of reporting is voluntary, the agency admits that only between one and 10% of adverse reactions get recorded. Which means, because the FDA and Big Pharma intentionally delayed warning the public about the dangers of ADHD drugs, there are probably tens of thousands of ADHD victims who do not even know what happened.</p> \\n\\n<p>Persons interested in more information on legal matters related ADHD drugs can contact the Pogust &amp;amp; Braslow law firm at 610-941-4204, or <a href=\"http://www.pogustbraslow.com/\" type=\"external\">http://www.pogustbraslow.com/</a></p> \\n\\n<p>EVELYN PRINGLE is an investigative reporter.

This appears to allow teams to avoid the inflexible thinking experienced by fatigued individuals,\" said Daniel Frings, a senior lecturer in social psychology at London South Bank University, where the research was conducted. The study examined the problem-solving skills of 171 army officer cadets during a weekend training exercise. The results showed that individual soldiers who were fatigued performed significantly worse on the tests than alert soldiers.

              " 7814: '<p>Taking the stage at a community center in the small Northern California town of Bolinas, a group of four musicians quickly showed themselves to be returning as a vibrant creative force centered very much in the present.</p> \\n\\n<p>Not that the music of Country Joe and the Fish ever really disappeared. Since the release of the band&#8217;s first two albums in 1967 &#8212; &#8220;Electric Music for the Mind and Body&#8221; along with &#8220;I-Feel-Like-I&#8217;m-Fixin&#8217;-To-Die&#8221; &#8212; many of its songs have meandered through the memories and semi-consciousness of millions of Americans who came of age a third of a century ago.</p> \\n\\n<p>Now reconstituted with four of the legendary group&#8217;s original five members, the new Country Joe Band has just begun to tour. When I saw them perform, midway through April, the music was as tightly effusive as ever, with poetic lyrics mostly brought to bear on two perennials: love and death.</p> \\n\\n<p>Their new song &#8220;Cakewalk to Baghdad&#8221; is in sync with Country Joe McDonald&#8217;s compositions that stretch back to the escalating years of the Vietnam War. With the post-&#8220;victory&#8221; occupation of Iraq in its thirteenth month bringing death to many people including children, his old song &#8220;An Untitled Protest&#8221; remains unfailingly current. Sung the other night, it was no more dated than today: &#8220;Red and swollen tears tumble from her eyes / While cold silver birds who came to cruise the skies / Send death down to bend and twist her tiny hands / And then proceed to target &#8216;B&#8217; in keeping with their plans.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>No less than its previous incarnation, the Country Joe Band exemplifies how rock music can transcend itself as an art form. This is no small feat for any musicians, including those who create songs that encourage resistance to deadly routines of the status quo.</p> \\n\\n<p>Rhetoric is destructive to art. On the other hand, ambiguous or self-absorbed artistry is apt to be isolated from key social realities. But the Country Joe Band is not agitprop or evasive. For an overview, take a look at <a href=\"http://www.countryjoe.com/\" type=\"external\">www.countryjoe.com</a> &#8212; a website that reflects how a creative process can stay grounded in humanistic projects of our times.</p> \\n\\n<p>Songs that Country Joe and the Fish released in 1967 are so intricate that an attentive listener is bound to agree with McDonald&#8217;s recent comment to an interviewer: &#8220;Those songs are very complex and difficult to play, they&#8217;re less rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll and perhaps more &#8230; well, symphonic.&#8221; Rendered by the Country Joe Band, the psychedelic sound can seem orchestral. Yet there&#8217;s still no reliance on high-tech sound effects.</p> \\n\\n<p>By now, apparently, we&#8217;d be foolish to take the integrity of talented artists for granted. Maybe, as a late &#8217;60s advertisement proclaimed, &#8220;the man can&#8217;t bust our music&#8221; &#8212; but the corporate system can sure water it down a lot. Or turn music into outright pabulum. Television showcases plenty of grim results when so many knees bend toward corporatized altars.</p> \\n\\n<p>These days, cynicism about famous musicians with protest credentials is running high. Weeks ago, Bob Dylan began to appear in a Victoria&#8217;s Secret commercial. It may seem that the times they are a prostitutin&#8217;.</p> \\n\\n<p>Media outlets are filled with ads, commercial plugs and vapid &#8212; or corrosive &#8212; content leaving the impression that gifted artists sell out to the almighty dollar sooner or later. &#8220;Today&#8217;s musical superstars seem more interested in hawking their clothing lines and name-brand perfumes than in any meaningful form of political action,&#8221; magazine editor Leslie Bennetts wrote in a Los Angeles Times essay. By coincidence, the article appeared on the same day that I saw the Country Joe Band in concert.</p> \\n\\n<p>Unlike the profuse and dreary examples now personified by Dylan, quite a few musicians &#8212; renowned or scarcely known &#8212; have successfully struggled to retain creative control over their work. They continue to resist the corporate juggernauts that routinely flatten talent into the pap of pop.</p> \\n\\n<p>A new development to celebrate is the rise of the Country Joe Band. While standing the test of time, music from the ensemble group resonates profoundly each day as young Americans in uniform do their best to survive in a faraway country: &#8220;And pound their feet into the sand of shores they&#8217;ve never seen / Delegates from the western land to join the death machine / And we send cards and letters.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>It happens that Country Joe McDonald and the band&#8217;s other musicians have returned to public space together at a time when many American soldiers &#8212; following the orders of the commander in chief &#8212; are continuing to kill and be killed. An old question is also new: What are we fighting for?</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;And those who took so long to learn the subtle ways of death / Lie and bleed in paddy mud with questions on their breath / And we send prayers and praises.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>NORMAN SOLOMON is executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy in San Francisco.

In addition to the families buried here since the founding of Falfurrias in the early 20th century, Sacred Heart also has corners and holes reserved for its newest group:&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.caller.com/news/local/mass-graves-of-migrants-found-in-falfurrias--video-ep-459273104.html\" type=\"external\">immigrants found dead</a> <a href=\"http://www.caller.com/news/local/mass-graves-of-migrants-found-in-falfurrias--video-ep-459273104.html\" type=\"external\">on the giant ranches farther south</a>.</p> \\n\\n<p>Villareal looks over at the graves, victims of the odyssey from Central America to the border. &#8220;The saddest thing is seeing the mothers and children, especially the skulls of bebitos,&#8221; he says. &#8220;There are many [immigrants] still in the mass graves ... and the season is getting hot again, and many more will die.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Buried alongside them are some victims or relatives of victims of La Matanza, or The Massacre, when Texas rangers shot, hanged&amp;#160;and killed as many as several thousand Tejanos and Mexicans throughout south Texas between 1910 and 1920, at the height of the Progressive Era.</p> \\n\\n<p>Back then, when Mexicans and Tejanos were trying to hold onto what land remained after the Mexican-American War, land-owning progressives like Falfurrias&#8217; founder, Edward Cunningham Lasater, invited state rangers to undertake what we would today call the &#8220;militarization of the border.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Some of these white progressives are buried right next to Sacred Heart, where, Villareal says, they were once more clearly separated from the Mexicans by a long fence, a border of the dead that he says he played near as a boy. &#8220;There&#8217;s still mostly whites buried here on this side,&#8221; Villareal says, &#8220;but now there are some Tejanos here too.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p /> \\n\\n<p>Juan Manuel Villareal points to where a fence once divided the white dead from the Tejano dead.&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>Roberto Lovato</p> \\n\\n<p>Villareal&#8217;s great grandparents arrived in Falfurrias during that time &#8212; back when the border was only a word. They witnessed the birth of the Progressive Era and the progressive politics that focused on reforming education, social welfare&amp;#160;and the workplace, some of the same ideas that inform today&#8217;s progressive movement. Though today and yesterday&#8217;s progressives share a belief in the often destructive idea of &#8220;progress,&#8221; which leaves stolen land, mass exploitation, and even death in its path, today&#8217;s progressives are different in terms of issues like labor, women\\'s suffrage&amp;#160;and the environment, issues that have evolved or emerged since the early 1920s.</p> \\n\\n<p>But ask Latinos whether they feel included today, and many will say, &#8220;No.&#8221; Just look at the boards and staff rosters of most leading US progressive organizations for the environment, women, labor&amp;#160;or media. Many Latinos believe that in order to look beyond what still separates us, we have to also look backward at what separated us early on.</p> \\n\\n<p>Today&#8217;s progressives in Texas have little to no idea about La Matanza and how it began to expand the barriers between Latinos and whites. Without looking at the history and the borders between them, Latinos and progressives will simply continue the decades-long dance that has resulted in Latino exclusion from leadership positions in progressive institutions and, some would argue, from involvement in the movement as a whole. The exclusion of Latinos leaves the progressive movement without the vital force of <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/06/25/u-s-hispanic-population-growth-surge-cools/\" type=\"external\">55 million people</a>. In order to undertake this necessary national, regional&amp;#160;and local dialogue, the progressive movement will have to question what defines them, to the point where they question the term &#8220;progressive&#8221; and its etymological parent &#8220;progress&#8221; too.</p> \\n\\n<p>Like in south Texas, Latinos throughout the United States have viewed and continue to view progress and progressivism skeptically. Some Latinos identify as &#8220;progressives,&#8221; but many more of us feel that, like the graves of Sacred Heart, we&#8217;ve been bordered off from a progressivism that has not really embraced us or our issues.</p> \\n\\n<p>Progressives today are more evolved than Lasater and other elders of US&amp;#160;progressivism, but remnants of the racial and political borders found in Falfurrias in the 19th and 20th centuries remain. Just look at the comments of any article on immigration in any progressive publication, and you will see the ghosts of south Texas. You will hear the voices of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Many Latinos feel progressives don&#8217;t understand why Latinos are disillusioned with President Barack Obama&#8217;s immigration policies that&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/10/02/u-s-deportations-of-immigrants-reach-record-high-in-2013/\" type=\"external\">deport millions</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/removal-statistics\" type=\"external\">jail hundreds of thousands</a>, and result in the deaths of many &#8212; as shown by a <a href=\"http://www.latinodecisions.com/blog/2013/06/11/latino-voters-oppose-excessive-enforcement-and-punitive-measures-in-immigration-reform/\" type=\"external\">2013 poll released by Presente.org</a>, a Latino advocacy organization I co-founded.</p> \\n\\n<p>Latinos are creating super majorities like those in south Texas&#8217; Lower Rio Grande Valley, where the population is <a href=\"http://greatertexasfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/South-Texas-Short-Research-Loop-FINAL.pdf\" type=\"external\">about 90 percent Latino</a>. The rise of the Latino population is becoming a unique force in its own right with its own history and destiny &#8212; not as a Spanish-speaking junior partner to the black community, which includes many Afro-Latinos who identify as both. If our political imagination does not expand beyond the black-white binary that began and still defines US culture and politics, including progressive politics, then the future of progressivism and left-Latino politics will look a lot like the cemeteries of Falfurrias: old and segregated. Such a political imagination would transcend the wreckage that progress leaves in places like south Texas.</p> \\n\\n<p>In this sense, Latinos have much to offer whatever politic of the future replaces progressivism. &#8220;Latinos&#8221; and &#8220;Latin Americans&#8221; &#8212; two hybrid peoples born of the arrival and birth and perpetual crisis of capitalism during the discovery of the New World in the 15th and 16th centuries &#8212; remain a people who know crisis and how to face it. We know that the global forces destroying trees and land, displacing and killing migrants, and controlling ever greater amounts of space, governments&amp;#160;and political imagination will require uniting with others within and beyond our borders.</p> \\n\\n<p>Latinos are uniquely positioned for such struggles of the borderless world. Bigots, haters&amp;#160;and even the well-meaning are threatened by how Latino identity and politics challenge sacrosanct ideas about borders or sovereignty. Many unique Latino characteristics &#8212; a population of 55 million connected by a contiguous border; a presence in the Southwest that predates the United States itself; a language reinforced daily, hourly by multi-billion dollar industries and the likes of Univision and Telemundo &#8212; connect Latinos to the rest of the planet and continent in powerful ways that scare some progressives.</p> \\n\\n<p>Progressives who engage in global fights against issues like free trade and climate change are the exception in a body that uncritically accepts the bordering off of people as an &#8220;American&#8221; given. And the many of us who look at the debris of &#8220;progress&#8221; &#8212; impoverishment of the majority, greater wealth gaps, disintegration of the family &#8212; also see the urgent need to move beyond its borders.</p> \\n\\n<p>In Falfurrias and across the United States, progressivism has ceded the Latino segment of the political system to the Democratic Party in much the same way that it has ceded considerable political space among working-class whites to the forces behind Trump and Cruz. The lack of investment in building a progressive infrastructure in these working-class communities is a problem for the progressive movement and its institutions.</p> \\n\\n<p>The inability to link working-class Latino interests with those of the black and white working classes constitutes one of the greatest political failures of our time. Such a situation demands we do everything we can to expand the political imagination, including letting go of our long-held notions of &#8220;progress&#8221; and &#8220;progressivism.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Though it&#8217;s clear that we&#8217;ve exhausted the limits of the two-party system, a sensibility fueling the passionate support for Bernie Sanders, we have yet to expand our conception of politics to include what is obvious to many: We need political parties tied to social movements. Those of us from or with roots in Latin America, where political parties are often tied to social movements, see the need to make &#8220;America,&#8221; the country, look more like Am&#233;rica, the sometimes insurgent continent.</p> \\n\\n<p>The unprecedented immigrant rights marches of 2006, when more than 200 cities and towns mobilized millions, were fueled, in part, by Latinos who have experience organizing in Latin America. Many Latino leaders from Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, the Caribbean&amp;#160;and South America first learned to fight against US-backed regimes.</p> \\n\\n<p>We in the United States can, instead of moving forward with the march of progress, look backward. We can do the urgent and necessary work of altering &#8220;America&#8221; to include Latinos in the national conversation &#8212; not just when it comes to immigration and the Hispanic vote.</p> \\n\\n<p>In Texas, excavations of mass graves and stories of matanzas of Manifest Destinies past will help the United States better understand the unacknowledged results of that past: Latin Americans made desperate by US economic and military policies migrating northward to the origin of the problem.</p> \\n\\n<p>Latinos living in the United States already know the problem. We know it much like Jos&#233; Mart&#237;, the Cuban revolutionary poet who described our lived experience as living in the &#8220;belly of the beast.&#8221; The question is will we own that problem in a manner that acknowledges the limits of progress and progressivism that excludes Latinos?</p> \\n\\n<p>Given the challenges facing progressives, Latinos, and the entire planet, those of us committed to keeping the beast healthy have no choice but to move beyond the limits of progress and progressivism that have failed to connect history with the outcomes of today.</p> \\n\\n<p>This&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/progressive-politics-dont-feel-so-inclusive-when-youre-latino-20160418\" type=\"external\">story</a>&amp;#160;was originally published by&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.yesmagazine.org/\" type=\"external\">YES!

              " 7830: '<p>It&#8217;s been three days since a commercial plane was <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">shot down over Ukraine</a>, killing the hundreds of people on board. While some of the questions about the crash have been resolved, many details remain murky, and new controversies have begun to unfold. Here&#8217;s what has happened since Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 fell from the sky on Thursday:</p> \\n\\n<p>A list of all the passengers and crew members aboard MH17 has been released.</p> \\n\\n<p>On Saturday, the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/19/world/europe/20jet-manifest.html\" type=\"external\">official manifest</a> from the flight was released, providing a comprehensive list of the people who were aboard MH17. That helped bring clarity to some earlier reports about the passengers; for instance, although it was initially feared that as many as <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">100 prominent AIDS researchers</a> were on the plane on their way to a major public health conference, the manifest reveals that just <a href=\"https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/world/a/24501176/aids-conference-spared-worst-with-malaysia-plane-toll-at-six/\" type=\"external\">six conference attendees</a> were on the flight.

Ukrainian officials say that armed rebels forced the emergency workers at the scene to hand over all 196 bodies, and then loaded them onto refrigerated train cars bound for the rebel-held city of Torez. One emergency worker <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ukraine-plane-crash/mh17-victims-bodies-seized-gunpoint-rebels-put-train-n160481\" type=\"external\">told the Associated Press</a> that they simply had no choice but to relinquish the bodies: &#8220;They are armed and we are not. The militiamen came, put the bodies onto the trucks and took them away.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The rebel leaders <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ukraine-plane-crash/mh17-bodies-were-removed-rebels-being-humane-borodai-says-n160451\" type=\"external\">say they removed the bodies</a> in order be &#8220;humane,&#8221; intending to keep them preserved until they&#8217;re able to be identified. They maintain that they will not withhold them from Western powers. But the move has horrified the international community. &#8220;What&#8217;s happening is really grotesque,&#8221; Secretary of State John Kerry <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidgregory/statuses/490844046383153152\" type=\"external\">said on Meet The Press</a> on Sunday morning. A statement from his office <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ukraine-plane-crash/mh17-bodies-were-removed-rebels-being-humane-borodai-says-n160451\" type=\"external\">added</a> that seizing the bodies represents an &#8220;affront to all those who lost loved ones and to the dignity the victims deserve.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>There will be an international investigation into the crash, although rebels are already being accused of tampering with evidence.</p> \\n\\n<p>On Friday, President Obama called for a &#8220; <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/malaysia-plane-shot-down-ukraine-investigation-109087.html\" type=\"external\">credible international investigation</a>&#8221; into what happened with MH17. Ukraine has also <a href=\"http://www.wjla.com/articles/2014/07/ukraine-says-russia-helping-destroy-malaysia-airlines-crash-evidence-105232.html\" type=\"external\">urged Moscow</a> to exert its influence over the pro-Russia rebels to ensure that international experts are given the ability to conduct a &#8220;thorough, impartial investigation&#8221; into the plane crash.

The U.S. State Department has accused separatist rebels of <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ukraine-plane-crash/u-s-criticizes-tampering-mh17-jet-crash-site-n160396\" type=\"external\">tampering with the evidence</a> at the crash site.</p> \\n\\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ukraine-plane-crash/u-s-criticizes-tampering-mh17-jet-crash-site-n160396\" type=\"external\">reports</a>, &#8220;intoxicated, aggressive gunmen&#8221; have been preventing international monitors from having enough access to the remains. In addition to bodies being removed, monitors from Europe&#8217;s Organization for Security and Cooperation say that debris and evidence is also being dragged away from the area. There are questions about <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ukraine-plane-crash/video-shows-malaysia-airlines-mh17s-black-box-crash-scene-n160491\" type=\"external\">where the black boxes actually are</a> and whether the rebels have moved them.

But we need a full access to this site in order to conduct a thorough investigation.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>U.S. and Ukrainian officials say there&#8217;s mounting evidence that Russia supplied the technology necessary to shoot down the plane.</p> \\n\\n<p>Who&#8217;s really at fault for the crash has been an <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">open question</a>&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;the Russian rebels maintain they don&#8217;t have the capacity to shoot down a plane at that height; Ukraine insists that the rebels must have done it with help from Russia; and Russian officials have denied all involvement and suggested that Kiev&#8217;s military is at fault. But officials from the United States and Ukraine are saying that the emerging evidence points to Russia.</p> \\n\\n<p>On Face the Nation, Kerry said that there&#8217;s an &#8220;enormous amount of evidence&#8221; that Russia supplied the separatist rebels with the training and tools they needed to shoot down the Malaysian plane, pointing out that this isn&#8217;t the first time they&#8217;ve <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/7/18/5914139/ukrainian-rebels-shot-down-two-planes-in-the-last-month\" type=\"external\">shot down an aircraft</a>.

              " 7908: \"<p /> \\n\\n<p>Jane Golden is driving by a corner of North Philadelphia that most people, given the chance, would leave as fast as they could. Golden, however, is riding the brake: She can&#8217;t go slow enough. &#8220;Over there!&#8221; she calls. Over there is a bleak row of tumbledown, three-story buildings that would seem uninhabitable but for the people walking in and out of them. Yet Golden, who directs the city&#8217;s Mural Arts Program, the most prolific mural project in the country, sees the place differently.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that a terrific wall!&#8221; she exclaims. The wall is aged brick and runs the length of the building. It used to be attached to the row house next door, but that building is long gone, as are many in this neighborhood, and in its place is a vacant, trash-strewn lot.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;We could do a lot with that wall,&#8221; says Golden, an artist herself. She turns the corner. On another stretch of brick, the mural program has painted a three-story tribute to Rachel Bagby and Lloyd Logan, two community leaders, their faces serious and forceful and of a size usually seen on billboards, selling something. (Here they are selling, too: commitment and neighborhood pride.) Half a block later, on the back side of the Jones Memorial Baptist Church, is a panorama of city life, the city life of this very street, in fact, of boys riding bikes, and men and women going about their business as seen through the windows of tenements, and these words from Proverbs 15:3 wrapped around it all like a stole: &#8220;The eyes of the Lord are in every place beholding the evil and the good.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Golden pulls up to a stoplight. The likeness of the late musician Grover Washington Jr., who lived here for much of his life, reaches 60 feet skyward, playing a saxophone 20 feet tall. Golden&#8217;s own creation, Peace Wall, a multicultural wheel of clasped hands, is in another neighborhood, maybe 100 murals away, maybe more. At last count, there were more than 2,100 murals in Philadelphia, and the number is growing steadily.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;The murals are all over the city,&#8221; Golden says, &#8220;though the majority are in neighborhoods that are the most neglected. People want to have beauty in their lives.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Much of North and West Philadelphia has fallen into ruin in recent decades, their neighborhoods scarred by more than 15,000 vacant lots and abandoned buildings. The residents who remain look to the murals for visual relief from the stark, denatured environments in which they live. There is the intricate mosaic of Salvador Gonzalez&#8217;s Butterflies of the Caribbean on Susquehanna Street, and Ras Malik&#8217;s agricultural triptych Seasons, whose perfect rows of ripe Big Boys are the backdrop, in summer, to real vines growing real tomatoes in a community garden tended by the residents of Howard and Master streets. And there are waterfalls, lots of waterfalls, on walls all over town.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;One mural I was painting, the people there said, &#8216;Put in a waterfall,'&#8221; says Ana Uribe, a muralist from Colombia who had already put waterfalls into a number of the murals she has painted in Philadelphia, where she now lives. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to. But they were insistent. They said they wanted the flowing water to show how things were going to be cleaned up and get better. They didn&#8217;t want to look at any more sadness. They said they already knew how bad things were and didn&#8217;t need to be reminded.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Over on Norris street, in North Philadelphia, block captain Ruth Birchett and her neighbors took a different approach. Though they, too, already knew how bad things were, they saw their mural as a kind of totem that could speak the truth of their lives, and change it.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;There used to be 50 houses on this street,&#8221; says Birchett, a 49-year-old African American woman with a youthful face, surveying a block that is defined, now, by what is missing. &#8220;There was an ice cream parlor and a bakery, a cleaners and a pharmacy.&#8221; Now there is no commerce at all, at least none that requires a storefront. A homeless shelter anchors one end of the street. Around the corner at the other end is a homemade shrine to the three young people who have been shot here so far this year. &#8220;We have lost so very much,&#8221; Birchett says. &#8220;This is a government-forsaken neighborhood.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The Norris Street project was painted in the summer of 2000, after Birchett submitted an application to the Mural Arts Program demonstrating the neighborhood&#8217;s support for a mural and its commitment to maintaining it. Competition was tough; the project receives 200 applications a year and only has the resources &#8212; from city and private funds &#8212; to paint about 75.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;The Mural Arts Program will not do a mural unless they know they can work directly with people in the neighborhood,&#8221; Birchett says, recounting the numerous planning meetings between residents and the mural artist, Cavin Jones, himself a resident of North Philadelphia, who was chosen by Golden and her staff from a roster of 300 artists. As with all of the city&#8217;s murals, the residents and the artist designed the mural jointly.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;The artist paints the picture,&#8221; says Ariel Bierbaum, who serves as the project&#8217;s director of community murals, &#8220;but the community paints the vision.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>In 1984, when Golden was hired to paint murals in Philadelphia, it was part of an official effort to stem the proliferation of graffiti in the city. Under her direction, young people &#8212; most of them graffiti artists themselves, teenagers who had never dipped a brush in watercolors or seen even the outside of an art museum &#8212; were enlisted and paid to put in &#8220;scrub time&#8221; and to learn how to paint murals. Golden introduced them to professional artists, to poetry, to fine arts. She and her small staff started after-school art programs and summer mural-painting programs and apprenticeship programs. More than 10,000 kids have participated so far, many of them year after year, through junior high and high school, internships, apprenticeships, and jobs.</p> \\n\\n<p>Beautification projects have been going on for decades in inner cities across America, often with striking results. But it is still remarkable, even to an artist and activist like Golden, how democracy can be advanced in real and tangible ways simply by putting paintings on the sides of buildings in communities that reflect the very failure of democracy. &#8220;I always thought murals made art accessible to people, and they do,&#8221; Golden says. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve witnessed how they create real neighborhood change, too.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Golden is standing with Ruth Birchett in front of the mural on Norris Street when she says this, both women tipping back their heads to take it all in. Covering the entire side of the last house on the block, the mural shows an elderly black couple looking down on the younger generations &#8212; on an anguished woman bemoaning the senseless violence in the neighborhood and on an unwed teenage mother cradling a baby. Traditional African symbols decorate the center of the towering canvas, as do a rainbow and a pair of clasped hands, each meant to convey its own message of hope tempered by love and remembrance. Still, the eye is drawn to the outline of a crack pipe that hovers in the picture like a ghost &#8212; a symbol, surely, but something more as well.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;The main economy here is the drug economy, which is why the crack pipe is in the picture,&#8221; Birchett explains. &#8220;The only people who had trouble with it were the &#8216;entrepreneurs.'&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>And this, it turns out, was a good thing. After the mural was painted, drug dealers no longer felt comfortable hanging out at Norris and 19th. They are still in the neighborhood, but with more and more murals dominating blocks like Ruth Birchett&#8217;s, the dealers have less and less room to maneuver. Invariably, once a mural goes up, it becomes a catalyst for other kinds of neighborhood improvements. Gardens are planted and tended, picnics are held there, people venture out of their homes, neighborhoods are reclaimed, communities are reconstituted.</p> \\n\\n<p>As if on cue, a woman about half Birchett&#8217;s age approaches the block captain and points to the strip of dirt between the mural and the sidewalk. It is barren, not counting soda bottles and plastic bags and shards of glass and brick.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;We have to do something about this,&#8221; the woman says, toeing the soil. Birchett agrees.</p> \\n\\n<p>They begin to make a plan: to get wood chips, to plant bulbs, to enlist volunteers. They agree to meet out here on the weekend with rakes and hoes and friends, and the woman moves on.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all community organizers now,&#8221; Birchett says, watching her go.</p> \\n\\n<p /> \\n\\n<p />\",\n",

But the film&#8217;s racism and enthusiastic support for American empire shouldn&#8217;t blind us to its lessons about the sociological and ideological factors that have allowed the US to stay at war for fourteen years with at least the partial support of an all-volunteer military.</p> \\n\\n<p>Many critical reviews of the movie&amp;#160;have claimed the real Kyle was closer to a <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2013/02/07/death_of_an_american_sniper/\" type=\"external\">psychopath</a> and a compulsive <a href=\"http://mpmacting.com/blog/2014/7/19/truth-justice-and-the-curious-case-of-chris-kyle\" type=\"external\">liar</a> than the conflicted victim of PTSD the film depicts. In&amp;#160;American Sniper, however, Kyle is a product of a domineering father and America&#8217;s genocidal past &#8212; as Eastwood reminds us with his regular references to cowboys and Westerns. But he is also a loving father, husband, and mentor to wounded Marines.</p> \\n\\n<p>To simply write off Kyle as a monster would be to ignore the people, institutions, and history that helped create him. Indeed, if Eastwood portrayed Kyle as a psychopath, the Seal would be less interesting and less politically relevant.</p> \\n\\n<p>While Kyle is rendered with more nuance than left critics have allowed, Iraqis are given no such courtesy. No Iraqi killed in American Sniper is portrayed as innocent. And there is no talk about the lies that put Kyle in the country in the first place, or that <a href=\"http://costsofwar.org/article/civilians-killed-and-wounded\" type=\"external\">70&amp;#160;percent</a> of those killed in America&#8217;s illegal war in Iraq have been civilians.</p> \\n\\n<p>Of course, it would be inaccurate to have it otherwise. To spend time dealing with the horror of civilian deaths or the lies of the Iraq war would be to ruminate on subjects that, as far as we can tell, hardly crossed Kyle&#8217;s mind. As he says in his memoir, &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t give a flying fuck about the Iraqis&#8221; and &#8220;If you see anyone from about sixteen to sixty-five and they&#8217;re male, shoot &#8217;em. Kill every male you see.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The Kyle played by Bradley Cooper is similar to the one that comes through in his memoir. Cooper refers to Iraqis as &#8220;savages&#8221; throughout; Kyle sees the entire population of Iraq as the enemy.</p> \\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s a worldview that&#8217;s ingrained in Kyle from a young age. In the early scenes of the film, Kyle&#8217;s father is lecturing Chris and his younger brother &#8212; who has just been beaten up on the playground &#8212; at the dinner table. The father&#8217;s comments, which could just as easily have been uttered by any of Kyle&#8217;s drill sergeants, are worth quoting at length. They are a window not just into Kyle, but the pathological mentality, that is partially responsible for keeping the US at war for a decade and a half&amp;#160;with an all-volunteer military:</p> \\n\\n<p>There are three types of people in this world: sheep, wolves, and sheepdogs. Some people prefer to think that evil doesn&#8217;t exist in the world. If there were ever dark on their doorsteps, they wouldn&#8217;t know how to protect themselves. Those are the sheep.</p> \\n\\n<p>Then you have predators who use violence to prey on the weak. They&#8217;re wolves. Then there are those who are blessed with the gift of aggression with an overpowering need to protect the flock. These men are the rare breed who live to confront the wolf. They are the sheep dog.</p> \\n\\n<p>We are not raising any sheep in this family. [The father takes off his belt, throws it on the table, and moves toward Chris and his brother]. I will whoop your ass if you turn into a wolf.</p> \\n\\n<p>For Kyle, the choice is hardly a choice at all: he must become an aggressive, wooly-eyed sheepdog if he wants to retain his father&#8217;s love.</p> \\n\\n<p>When the father pulls off his belt at the table, it foreshadows a scene near the end of the movie. Kyle is on leave between his third and fourth tour. He is in the backyard and sees the family dog mock-fighting with his son.&amp;#160;Kyle pulls off his own belt to attack the dog. However, it&#8217;s really the sheep dog &#8212; the symbolic representation of himself &#8212; that he tries to savage with the belt in the backyard. It is the sheep dog that poses the true threat to his family. We&#8217;re left with the sense that Kyle is confused about who the good and bad guys truly are.&amp;#160;And that deep down he questions what he has been taught by his father and his chain of command.</p> \\n\\n<p>The structure of the film reinforces the portrayal of Kyle&#8217;s personality type. Eastwood jumps between Kyle&#8217;s four tours and scenes of courtship, sex, children, and family stateside. In Kyle&#8217;s life there is nothing but war and family, life and death.</p> \\n\\n<p>American Sniper also conveys how racism is reinforced in war. The killing and dying scenes feel dangerously real, and there is hardly time to take a safe breath between them. The special effects and the unyielding script drive home the acute stress soldiers experience in battle.</p> \\n\\n<p>Eastwood also does a masterful job showing us how a soldier&#8217;s view of the world can be narrowed to the size of a rifle scope, of showing us how bonds between soldiers are formed: in combat, it seems the only people in the world are those standing to your left and right, keeping you alive. For someone like Kyle, all he sees beyond his fellow soldiers are wolves. After combat, particularly if a soldier loses a buddy, the racism that is used as a killing and survival tool can be hard to discard.</p> \\n\\n<p>Towards the end of the movie, the mother of a fallen Seal is reading at her son&#8217;s funeral the letter he&amp;#160;wrote before he was killed in Iraq. It questions war and its&amp;#160;glorification. The mom stumbles through the letter and is cut off by Marines playing Taps.</p> \\n\\n<p>The moment is easy to&amp;#160;overlook, but it is disturbing for someone&amp;#160;seeking&amp;#160;broader political context. Driving home from the funeral with his wife Taya, Kyle blames the letter for the Seal&#8217;s death.&amp;#160;Kyle thus shows that he is incapable of reflecting on the words of one of his closest friends. To do so would imperil his very identity. It would mean questioning his simplistic and wooden worldview that keeps him hungry for more kills and a sheep-dog defender of America&#8217;s wars. It would also mean becoming vulnerable in a combat zone.</p> \\n\\n<p>The scene also reminds us that there are soldiers who question war and that there aren&#8217;t enough outlets that allow for a full accounting of these questions, and the few that exist are too often suppressed.</p>',\n",
              " 7940: '<p>CHUCK TODD:</p> \\n\\n<p>Mr. President, thank you for your time. I appreciate it. Let me start with your interpretation of the deal, the nuclear deal. In January you called it a golden page in Iran&#8217;s history, opening new windows for engagement around the world. The president, President Obama yesterday said that it was an important-- hailed it as a big victory for diplomacy. But your government is now arguing that the U.S. is not living up to the deal. What specifically is the U.S. not doing, in your view, on this deal?</p> \\n\\n<p>ROUHANI:</p> \\n\\n<p>In my opinion, the JCPOA issue is of utmost importance for the success of political activity throughout today\\'s world. Perhaps in the last few decades for the first time, it has taken place in such a fashion that a very complex, international issue, through dialogue, has reached ultimate success in the form of the agreement. Now, for this success, all of the seven countries involved worked quite hard in order to realize it. And vis-&#224;-vis the JCPOA, it is in Iran\\'s view supervised by an international body which is the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p> \\n\\n<p>And according to that organization\\'s report, Iran has lived up to all of its commitments. I really do believe that this has been a historic test for all of us to measure how we keep to our commitments, to the commitments announced. How we have implemented those, how we have put those into action, or not. And, according to the admission of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Five Plus One countries, Iran has lived up to its commitments fully.</p> \\n\\n<p>However, the other side, unfortunately, the United States regarding some issues, has stayed back or it has actually gone against the agreement and the commitment. So within the JCPOA, it is contained that all nations involved in this agreement must free the path, pave the way for resumption of normal activities with the Islamic Republic of Iran, such as banking transactions, insurance transactions, and the likes.</p> \\n\\n<p>All of the obstacles must be removed according to the letter of the JCPOA. Now, the Treasury Department of the United States, instead of encouraging countries and nations and financial institutions to resume relationships with Iran, it has taken a threatening tone. And it is out of that fear of being the target of the Treasury Department of the United States that has given serious doubts to many of these financial international institutions.</p> \\n\\n<p>And this is a serious breach on behalf of the United States of America that must be alleviated, that must be corrected. And as all folks are quite aware, that in the framework of international agreement, if one side fails to live up to its commitment, then that means that commitment, that agreement cannot be sustainable in the future.</p> \\n\\n<p>CHUCK TODD:</p> \\n\\n<p>Is it possible this is a misunderstanding of the agreement? That-- because on the specifics of the nuclear agreement, the specific sanctions that involve the development of potential nuclear weapons, all of those obstacles have been removed. You have the approval of the license, in fact today, license for transactions having to do with airplanes, both in parts and in actual airplanes both for Boeing and Airbus that is coming along. But there are separate sanctions on development of ballistic missiles. Are there some in your country that believed all of those sanctions would be eliminated and just misinterpreted the deal?</p> \\n\\n<p>ROUHANI:</p> \\n\\n<p>No. There is a part specifically which speaks of multi-use goods. And a specific commission has been brought into the framework of the JCPOA agreement, through which any grievances would be addressed. However, what we\\'re talking about is that international big financial institutions, banks who wish to cooperate and collaborate financially in expansion of ports, of infrastructure expansion and building, acquisition of airplanes for civil aviation, they have become very doubtful.</p> \\n\\n<p>So the United States, instead of encouraging these financial institutions, use multi-pronged words that are actually bringing fear to the heart of these banks, eliminating altogether the collaboration with Iran. And some banks actually prefer not to have any cooperation with Iran. The other breach of the agreement on the side of the United States, it has been brought into the JCPOA that airplanes intended for civil aviation only must be freely sold to Iran.</p> \\n\\n<p>Now, eight months have passed since the start of the JCPOA. During these eight months, the United States up to today has yet to issue these licenses for the acquisition of airplanes for civil aviation. And there are talks as recent as yesterday that the United States has agreed on some of the points that we just spoke of. Even if the United States were to fully issue those licenses we spoke of today, it is still quite in breach of the contract considering the eight months it has taken it to do so.</p> \\n\\n<p>CHUCK TODD:</p> \\n\\n<p>One of the issues that some international banks may be, one of the reasons that some of these international banks may be hesitant to do business with Iran, appears to be the role of the Revolutionary Guard in Iran&#8217;s economy, and of course that&#8217;s also tied into the ballistic missile sanctions that also are a part of this. Is there a way that Iran could diminish the role of the Guard in the economy that would then-- that you think would make international banks more comfortable to do business?</p> \\n\\n<p>ROUHANI:</p> \\n\\n<p>Companies-- Various companies do exist in Iran, the shares of some of which belong to business entities who may be having certain ties with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. But keep in mind those companies are strictly involved in business transactions and endeavors. A lot of major store affairs and highways and infrastructures and ports are being built and have been built in Iran throughout Iran by these very companies.</p> \\n\\n<p>Even in the field of development of oil and gas, those same companies are the ones who bring to bear their services. Now, the issue is in normal economic activity, such as port building, infrastructure, commercial infrastructure building, development of oil and gas, expansion of freeways and thoroughfares, those have nothing to do with military purposes. Any company can have shares that belong to any entity. But pressure on banks, vis-&#224;-vis their dealings with Iran, is certainly against the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action Agreement.</p> \\n\\n<p>CHUCK TODD:</p> \\n\\n<p>Let me just ask a big picture question. Are you still hopeful that this agreement is going to hold?</p> \\n\\n<p>ROUHANI:</p> \\n\\n<p>All of us, we must strive and work very hard for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action to hold because all of the hard work brought to bear by these seven countries for years, marathon sessions held by these countries for months at a time, weeks at a time. But if we cannot make it last, then that would mean that political activity, diplomatic activity, is unsuccessful.</p> \\n\\n<p>Now, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action can become a roadmap, an example to refer to upon which other international conflicts can be based. In other words, to resolve those issues through dialogue and diplomacy rather than conflict. So a breaking down of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action would be a defeat for all sides involved. Would be a defeat for the international community. Would be a defeat for diplomacy. No one would come out victorious from this defeat. So we must all bring our utmost to bear for its success.</p> \\n\\n<p>CHUCK TODD:</p> \\n\\n<p>As you are aware, there are critics of the deal in the United States, and there are critics of the deal in Iran. That&#8217;s not a surprise. But one of the concerns among critics of the deal in the United States is that the idea that in 8 years from now, when the deal expires, that Iran will be free to pursue a nuclear weapons program. And there is concern among these critics, which may be why they want to do whatever it takes to slow it down, or to delay, or to make this harder. That there is a concern that in 8 years that all of a sudden Iran will pursue a nuclear weapons program. How can you reassure these skeptics in the United States that that&#8217;s not the case?</p> \\n\\n<p>ROUHANI:</p> \\n\\n<p>Vis-&#224;-vis all of the countries in order for them to remain on the peaceful path of nuclear activity, there is an international organization that has been created, has been in existence for quite some time, which is the International Atomic Energy Agency. And this agency supervises the peaceful and civilian purposes only nuclear activity of its member countries.</p> \\n\\n<p>And in order for this system of supervision and verification to be successful and sustainable, additional protocols and safeguards have been put in place, to which Iran has committed. So in other words, Iran is implementing not only the additional protocols, but the safeguards as well. And anyone who has read these too knows full well and understands full well that anyone that signs, that is a signatory to those, will over the long-term maintain nothing but peaceful nuclear activity.</p> \\n\\n<p>Furthermore, within the doctrine or within the laws of the Islamic Republic of Iran to include the fatwa issued by the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, that the building or pursuing or obtaining and using any type of weapons of mass destruction are strictly and unequivocally forbidden by Islamic law.</p> \\n\\n<p>CHUCK TODD:</p> \\n\\n<p>Should there be any concern, though, that there are reports that there is a missile defense system at Fordow, for instance that was purchased from the Russians? That there&#8217;s a Russian missile defense system -- should that be of concern, that you&#8217;re putting a defense system around a peaceful nuclear facility?</p> \\n\\n<p>ROUHANI:</p> \\n\\n<p>Well, Fordow is one of the nuclear centers that is being supervised by the International Atomic Energy Agency, just like all of the nuclear activities of the Islamic Republic of Iran throughout the country that are being supervised by the agency. But we do have enemies throughout the region who may have ill intentions towards us.</p> \\n\\n<p>And, of course, we must be ready to defend ourselves. We must not forget that we\\'re a country who sustained the brunt of an imposed war by Saddam Hussein for eight years. So we learned in result of that war, that we must be solely responsible and rely solely upon ourselves to defend ourselves. No one helped our country during those eight years of imposed illegal war. But everyone got in line to help Saddam Hussein.</p> \\n\\n<p>CHUCK TODD:</p> \\n\\n<p>So nobody-- so you don&#8217;t think you would tell any skeptics of the deal in the United States that the extra security does not mean that Iran is trying to protect that facility to eventually develop weapons?</p> \\n\\n<p>ROUHANI:</p> \\n\\n<p>Well, in any fashion, when one looks at the history of Iran, Iran has always maintained her commitment to any agreement it has become a signatory of. You will not find any instances during the past 38 years of the history of the Islamic Republic of Iran in which a bilateral agreement or an international agreement has been signed and Iran has broken its commitment.</p> \\n\\n<p>So Iran has a very good report card vis-&#224;-vis her commitments and agreements. Also, let it be said that nuclear weapons would not be beneficial to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Islamic Republic of Iran has never sought nuclear weapons. What we were accused of for years called possible military dimensions, the International Atomic Energy Agency eventually reached the conclusion that that file must be closed for good and announced that the activities of Iran were solely for peaceful purposes.</p> \\n\\n<p>CHUCK TODD:</p> \\n\\n<p>Okay, let&#8217;s move onto Syria. Big discussion today at the United Nations. The U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry, believes that Russia was behind the-- and it may have been on purpose or not, that\\'s an open question-- but that Russia was behind the bombing of the humanitarian, United Nations humanitarian convoy. What can you tell us about that incident and what do you believe?</p> \\n\\n<p>ROUHANI:</p> \\n\\n<p>Well, the United States a few years-- a few days before, committed a very dangerous act which was to, in the Deir el-Zour region of Syria, bomb a Syrian army installation under conditions at that specific time that there were clashes going on between the terrorists-- the Daesh terrorists and the Syrian army. So that meant a direct defense of the Daesh terrorist group.</p> \\n\\n<p>And to go back another couple of days in another region of Syria, Israel conducted aerial bombings of other Syrian installations. So it has become increasingly possible that this does happen. But we must all bring to bear our best efforts in order to have a sustained ceasefire in Syria so that food stuff and medicines can get to those who are in need and have been waiting for those supplies for months.</p> \\n\\n<p>CHUCK TODD:</p> \\n\\n<p>John Kerry was emphatic today, ground all planes. I think you may have heard him say this or heard that he said something like this especially in the Northern part. Would you support a temporary grounding whether it&#8217;s the Syrians, the Russians, the United States, the Turks, everybody ground planes temporarily while there&#8217;s a reassessment?</p> \\n\\n<p>ROUHANI:</p> \\n\\n<p>Well, what is supposed to happen is that the war and the battle would continue against the Daesh terrorists. So if you ground all planes that would mean that Daesh can continue its savage killings with more vigor. You do know that a considerable part of the Syrian territory has come under the control of the Daesh or Jabhat-al-Nusra terrorists.</p> \\n\\n<p>And in all of these discussions and the essence of the discussion has been to have sustained attack on the terrorist positions, to bomb them. To keep them under pressure. So if you ground all airplanes, then it would 100% benefit the terrorists, the Daesh terrorists. So to move towards that direction would mean a move towards benefiting terrorism.</p> \\n\\n<p>CHUCK TODD:</p> \\n\\n<p>But if there&#8217;s not even a temporary grounding, how does any humanitarian aid-- you just described, essentially you were saying what is happened were accidents, or you described that this could happen when you have all sorts of different planes in the air and different targets sometimes or different interpretations of who&#8217;s with Daesh and who isn&#8217;t. But if there is no temporary grounding, would you support a temporary grounding even if just a week, two weeks, to get aid there so that the United Nations could get aid there? Would you support something like that?</p> \\n\\n<p>ROUHANI:</p> \\n\\n<p>I\\'m certain that you\\'re aware that previously, the United Nations, through various regions of Syria, has brought to the scene humanitarian aid. Any proposal can be coordinated in order to avoid the targeting of humanitarian convoys. Everyone can announce it to one another, everyone present on the scene so that no one in that route would come under attack. But that would mean that we must temporarily or permanently ground all flights simply because on one or more routes there are humanitarian aid convoys moving. And that cannot be a solution in order to avoid the targeting of such convoys.</p> \\n\\n<p>CHUCK TODD:</p> \\n\\n<p>President Obama, President Putin, I believe yourself, others have said there needs to be a political process to end the war in Syria. Can Iran live with a Syria that is not headed up by Assad?</p> \\n\\n<p>ROUHANI:</p> \\n\\n<p>What is of utmost importance is to understand that Syria doesn\\'t have a military solution. And the Syrian problems must certainly be resolved politically. Only politically. What is important for us in Syria is that her territorial integrity is maintained. The uniformity of Syria be maintained, that it will not be divvied up.</p> \\n\\n<p>And it is important for us that the terrorists be driven out of Syria. And for sustained attack to continue on the terrorists. And it is important for us that in the future governance of Syria, all groups and parties be present. Be it the government of Syria, be it the opposition, for them to have their own roles in the future of the Syrian government.</p> \\n\\n<p>But who would be the president in a future of Syria? Who would govern? Who would be the representative to their parliament? That must be only reached through independent and free vote of the Syrian people. Whomever they choose must be approved and respected. Therefore, the rule of the ballot box and the rule of the Syrian people and the will of the Syrian people should be the sole determinant of the future of the country.</p> \\n\\n<p>CHUCK TODD:</p> \\n\\n<p>There has been some indirect U.S. and Iran cooperation against Daesh or ISIS, ISIL everybody has a different name for it, and it&#8217;s been done through the Iraqis. Can you explain how this indirect relationship works and is there-- is there good communication between the U.S. and Iran when dealing with Daesh or ISIS in Iraq?</p> \\n\\n<p>ROUHANI:</p> \\n\\n<p>We have no direct contact between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran in the fight against Daesh. Perhaps these contacts do exist between the Iraqi government and the United States, or perhaps between Russia and the United States. But both in Syria and Iraq, the aid that we bring to the scene are to the government of those countries, based upon the request of those governments.</p> \\n\\n<p>If we render aid in Iraq has been on-- based on the request of the sovereign government of Iraq. And in Syria whatever we have brought to the scene has been based on that same request of the Syrian government. Based on the principle that any cooperation throughout the region or even outside the region must be centralized on the request of the government in that country, be it in Iraq or Syria.</p> \\n\\n<p>CHUCK TODD:</p> \\n\\n<p>Thank you Mr. President. I want to ask about some prisoners that are being held in Iran. As we speak, there are dual nationals currently being held including three Americans. I hope I get these names right. Siamak Namazi had advocated for closer ties to the U.S. and Iran. His father who is in the 80s. Earlier this week we learned about a U.S. resident by the name of Nizar Zakka who has been advocating for internet freedom. He was just sentenced to ten years in prison. There&#8217;s a British-Iranian woman, charity worker, who was sentenced to five years in prison. She had travelled to Iran with her toddler daughter. Several of these prisoners are elderly. They&#8217;re in poor health. What is your government doing to resolve this?</p> \\n\\n<p>ROUHANI:</p> \\n\\n<p>Well, first of all, you do know that dual citizenship is not recognized under Iranian law. Therefore, those who have dual citizenship from the interpretation of the Iranian laws are Iranian citizens solely and only. And any legal prosecution is carried out on the foundation that they\\'re Iranian citizens, subject to Iranian law. Now, the government, on behalf of all of those who are either going through the court system or are in prison, we work hard so that the laws apply to all of them equally.</p> \\n\\n<p>The processes apply to all of them equally. And the responsibility of the president of the Islamic Republic is to supervise to ensure the full implementation of the constitution. So the full implementation of the constitution of the Islamic Republic is the responsibility of the president.</p> \\n\\n<p>CHUCK TODD:</p> \\n\\n<p>Okay, let me ask you another question related to the release of some hostages. There were several cash payments that Iran received from the United States earlier this year. Some critics of that in the United States Senate argue that the money was a ransom payment, a quid pro quo, if you will, for the four Americans that were released in January. Was it? Was-- did you feel as if-- were you waiting to release the prisoners until the money that was agreed to be sent back, money that was held that was belonged to Iran from 1979. Did-- were the hostages being held until that money was transferred over?</p> \\n\\n<p>ROUHANI:</p> \\n\\n<p>There were two issues. One of them were the sums of monies belonging to the nation of Iran left in the United States, seized in the United States. And there are still considerable sums of money in the United States that belong to our nation. And we\\'re currently conducting conversations and various dialogues in order to return this money to Iran. Some things that we could not agree upon, there are ways to address those in the international court system.</p> \\n\\n<p>Now, vis-&#224;-vis the imprisonment of those Iranians or those Iranians who are imprisoned in the United States, or were being prosecuted by the United States, or the same for those who were being held in Iran with dual citizenship. So we worked quite hard in order to have a concerted effort to free those from both sides. Both the Iranians who were being held or prosecuted in the United States, as well as those who were sentenced in Iran and had served some of their prison terms. And they were pardoned for the remainder of their prison term.</p> \\n\\n<p>So there were these two issues that were being talked about simultaneously on parallel tracks. And perhaps these dialogues can be still conducted simultaneously on parallel tracks while we\\'re conducting those same conversations in order to free the sums of money that are still owed to us. In other words, these are the monies belonging to the Iranian nation, left in the United States for 38 years and must be returned to its rightful owner.</p> \\n\\n<p>CHUCK TODD:</p> \\n\\n<p>Alright let me, time for one more question so I want to ask about our presidential election here in this country. Donald Trump has called the Iranian nuclear agreement a &#8220;horrible, horrible deal.&#8221; He said he wants to renegotiate it, not rip it up, at times. Hillary Clinton has said that her attitude with Iran will be and this agreement is to fulfill it but she comes at it through, she used a phrase &#8220;distrust but verify.&#8221; Which one of these candidates do you think Iran could have a better relationship with, when it comes to implementing the nuclear deal?</p> \\n\\n<p>ROUHANI:</p> \\n\\n<p>The issue of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is no longer an issue that encompasses only the United States of America and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Of course, throughout the atmosphere of presidential elections in the United States, candidates can bring up any topic that they see best suits the needs of their campaigns.</p> \\n\\n<p>But the reality remains that when the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was passed based on the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 and was approved unanimously, that became an international agreement. So the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is an international agreement approved by the Security Council. So all of the administrations and the United States are united in having reached this agreement. No one can say here or there that, \"I don\\'t accept this agreement. I want to renegotiate it.\" This has purely an electoral benefit effect for some.</p> \\n\\n<p>CHUCK TODD:</p> \\n\\n<p>Do you believe Iran can have a similar relationship with the next American president that it has, that you have with President Obama?</p> \\n\\n<p>ROUHANI:</p> \\n\\n<p>Everything is dependent upon the conditions when we get to that point in time. In any fashion, if the future administration of the United States wishes to continue its animosity towards Iran, then, of course, it will receive the appropriate response. But if it wishes to bring an end to that animosity and start respecting the rightful-- the right of the Iranian nation, whereas it has trampled upon those rights in many instances in the past, then, of course, it will receive the appropriate response in that scenario as well.</p> \\n\\n<p>CHUCK TODD:</p> \\n\\n<p>Mr. President, thank you for your time. Please travel safe back to your home. Thank you.</p> \\n\\n<p>ROUHANI:</p> \\n\\n<p>I thank you so much. God bless you.</p>',\n",

Now, Trump has given up and announced that he will simply declare the agreement to not be in his interest &#8212; that is, the interest of war, the interest of someone seeking the profits and political high and domestic distraction of mass-murder-leadership and the music and flags and horse manure that accompany it.</p> \\n\\n<p>Meanwhile, the permanent U.S. bureaucracy, the mass media, and every friend of the Clinton family who hopes to retain that status, has persuaded most of the country on the basis of no evidence that Russia is an evil threatening demon that put Trump in office &#8212; and persuaded Trump not to pursue peace with Russia.</p> \\n\\n<p>Add to that the &#8212; thus far evidence-free &#8212; Trump administration claims that Cuba has been attacking U.S. personnel.</p> \\n\\n<p>And all of this is just the hunt for new wars that can be piled onto the almost unnoticed existing ones, including the war on Yemen waged by the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, the war on Syria based largely on lies about a government actually guilty of other crimes (including, not many years back, crimes in partnership with the U.S.), the war on Libya that rolls on despite the successful destruction of that country&#8217;s basic institutions, and of course the wars on Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, and Afghanistan &#8212; the latter a nation that even U.S. think tanks categorize as a dictatorship or failed state after 16 full years of liberation-murders.</p> \\n\\n<p>John Lennon once wrote these words.

              " 7982: '<p>A Democratic TV ad goes a little too far when it says GOP gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli&#8217;s new book &#8220;questions whether Medicare and Social Security should exist.&#8221; Cuccinelli&#8217;s book criticizes social welfare programs &#8212; including Social Security and Medicare &#8212; for making people dependent on government. But he pointedly writes: &#8220;I&#8217;m not questioning here the existence of these programs.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The Democratic Party of Virginia began airing the new ad, titled &#8220;Peggy,&#8221; July 14 in northern Virginia, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group, a unit of Kantar Media. Peggy is a retiree who pans Cuccinelli&#8217;s policy positions in his new book, &#8220; <a href=\"http://www.randomhouse.com/book/220745/the-last-line-of-defense-by-ken-cuccinelli\" type=\"external\">The Last Line of Defense</a>.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&amp;lt;iframe style=\"width: 500px; height:300px;\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen src=\"https://video.factcheck.org/play/a81affe0ade\"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;In his book,&#8221; Peggy says, &#8220;Cuccinelli questions whether Medicare and Social Security should exist, and said people are dependent on government.&#8221; The ad displays &#8220;page 62&#8221; as the source of the first claim and &#8220;page 63&#8221; for the second.</p> \\n\\n<p>There is no question that Cuccinelli writes that people are dependent on government programs. In a section subtitled &#8220;The Government is Not Benevolent,&#8221; he writes that &#8220;bad politicians&#8221; foster this dependency to amass power.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;The Last Line of Defense,&#8221; pages 62-63: Sometimes bad politicians set out to grow government in order to increase their own power and influence. This phenomenon doesn&#8217;t just happen in Washington; it happens at all levels of government. The amazing thing is that they often grow government without protest from citizens, and sometimes they even get buy-in from citizens &#8211; at least from the ones getting the goodies.</p> \\n\\n<p>One of their favorite ways to increase their power is by creating programs that dispense subsidized government benefits, such as Medicare, Social Security, and outright welfare (Medicaid, food stamps, subsidized housing, and the like). These programs make people dependent on government. And once people are dependent, they feel they can&#8217;t afford to have the programs taken away, no matter how inefficient, poorly run, or costly to the rest of society.</p> \\n\\n<p>He blames Democrats and Republicans alike for dispensing &#8220;goodies&#8221; and growing the size of government. He specifically criticizes Medicare Part D &#8212; the prescription-drug benefit program that was enacted by President George W. Bush with overwhelmingly Republican support in the <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2003/roll332.xml\" type=\"external\">House</a> and <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=108&amp;amp;session=1&amp;amp;vote=00459\" type=\"external\">Senate</a>.</p> \\n\\n<p>However, on page 238, Cuccinelli says: &#8220;I&#8217;m not questioning here the existence of these programs,&#8221; when he writes about the cost of Social Security, Medicare and defense programs. This time, he is writing in the context of economic growth and benefits of private-sector spending compared with government spending.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;The Last Line of Defense,&#8221; pages 237-238: A simple example of how private-sector spending increases economic growth more than government spending does would be a business that smartly spends $100 and expects to earn that amount back plus a return on its investment, so it turns $100 into, let&#8217;s say, $115. That&#8217;s economic growth.</p> \\n\\n<p>In contrast, despite how many times you may hear politicians talk about &#8220;investments&#8221; in government programs, government spends very little on what you could call &#8220;investments&#8221; that result in economic growth. For example, in 2011, the biggest programs in the federal government were Social Security (20 percent of the budget), national defense (20 percent), and Medicare (13.5 percent). There is no monetary return on these investments in any traditional business sense (that is, one invests money with a goal of getting a return in the form of interest, income or appreciation in value), although there are obviously other reasons America spends money on these programs.</p> \\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not questioning here the existence of these programs nor the wisdom of how much money is spent on them. What I&#8217;m trying to illustrate is that most dollars that government spends do not create economic growth but instead take money out of the hands of the people who do create economic growth.</p> \\n\\n<p>Cuccinelli clearly writes that people are dependent on government &#8212; just as the Democratic ad says. But it goes too far to say he &#8220;questions whether Medicare and Social Security should exist,&#8221; when in fact he writes he is &#8220;not questioning &#8230; the existence of these programs.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8212; Eugene Kiely, with Madeleine Stevens</p>',\n",

Evidence of a deeper problem lies in section F, where the paper has yet another Golden Gate Bridge photo to accompany a five-part series on&#8230; fog, penned by a onetime Chronicle health reporter. &#8220;Our Fabled Fog,&#8221; beckons the headline. And the subhead: &#8220;It&#8217;s part of the magic and beauty of San Francisco, permeating all avenues of life&#8212;and we should expect even more of it in the future&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>I thought the <a href=\"http://www.theonion.com\" type=\"external\">Onion</a> had ceased publishing in San Francisco.</p> \\n\\n<p>Look, with all respect to the good people at the Chron, many of whom are friends and old colleagues (and also to the Oakland Tribune, and daily newspapers across the land), we all know <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">where this is headed</a>. We read <a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=45\" type=\"external\">Romenesko</a>, after all.</p> \\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s not just the newspapers, of course. Local TV news, still where a good chunk of the populace gets its info, has been a bad joke forever. I recently learned just how bad.</p> \\n\\n<p>A few weeks ago, my friend Amy Shelf got a call from San Francisco&#8217;s KRON 4, a former NBC affiliate, now independent, that bills itself &#8220;the Bay Area&#8217;s News Station.&#8221; The caller, a polite young woman, wanted to set up a meeting with Amy to talk about opportunities for her to appear on the air and speak about legal issues&#8212;Amy is a lawyer.</p> \\n\\n<p>Was the caller a news producer? Not exactly. She wanted Amy to pay $1,000, presumably per month, to star in a five-minute monthly segment. Amy consulted her moral compass. &#8220;I was like, &#8216;I think that&#8217;s totally unethical,&#8217;&#8221; she tells me later, recalling the conversation. &#8220;And she said, &#8216;Well, it looks like the news.&#8217; And I said, &#8216;That&#8217;s exactly what makes it unethical!&#8217;&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>KRON&#8217;s sales rep quickly added that the paid segments were identified as such, but Amy still wasn&#8217;t buying. Proper disclosure, of course, would make the whole thing just a bit less slimy. So I went online and viewed some of the segments in question. There was plenty to be concerned about.</p> \\n\\n<p>Take Medical Mondays, KRON&#8217;s call-in health-advice show. The 24-minute segment is preceded by a seven-second disclaimer noting that the following program was paid for by Seton Medical Center. If you happened to tune it in after eight seconds, you&#8217;d be none the wiser.</p> \\n\\n<p>As promised by the saleswoman, this and similar programs have the look and feel of a real news-talk show, complete with a news ticker scrolling past underneath and chirons (the graphic tags that identify the person speaking) that are pretty much indistinguishable from those you&#8217;d see on regular news segments. Each paid segment is introduced by an anchor situated in what appears to be KRON&#8217;s newsroom. Medical Mondays is hosted by Vicki Liviakis, one of the station&#8217;s longtime anchors, who, according to KRON 4&#8217;s website &#8220;has traveled the globe covering stories from terrorism in the Middle East to devastating floods in the American Midwest.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Now she&#8217;s hawking condos. I watched a segment of another show, Bay Area Living. It appears under &#8220;Local Shows&#8221; on the station&#8217;s website, where it contains no paid-programming disclaimer. The lifestyle segment begins with video of a Vacaville, California, development called Belvedere Homes and a Liviakis voiceover: &#8220;Have you ever dreamt of living in an opulent old-world estate behind beautiful entry monuments and wrought-iron gates, amidst pristine buildings and landscaping lavished in old-world luxury? Now what if all this was located right here in the Bay Area?&#8221; (Camera cuts to the anchor pulling up to the gate in a cute convertible.) &#8220;Hi everybody, I&#8217;m Vicki Liviakis.

              " 7998: '<p>Suffering from depression and getting the flu aren&#8217;t the same thing, but mental illness is, for the most part, treated a lot like physical illness. Both are understood through a binary framework that distinguishes between health and sickness, order and disorder, function and dysfunction. This framework &#8212; the medical model &#8212; treats mental illnesses like depression and schizophrenia as natural, uniform entities that, like physical illnesses, can be empirically discovered and described. Just as you can get the flu, you can get depressed.</p> \\n\\n<p>The main purveyor of the medical model of mental illness is the <a href=\"http://www.psychiatry.org/practice/dsm\" type=\"external\">Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders</a>, or the DSM, a compendium of psychiatric disorders first issued in 1952 that conceptualizes mental illnesses as &#8220;dysfunctions&#8221; that occur &#8220;inside the head&#8221; of the patient.</p> \\n\\n<p>As anyone who has taken Intro to Psych knows, the DSM has been controversial from the start. Supporters argue that the medicalization of mental illness, as embodied by the DSM, is beneficial for those suffering from mental illness and their loved ones. It legitimates mental illness in the public discourse and undermines pervasive ideas that mental illness is not real or is exaggerated by patients &#8212; or that mental illness reflects a defect of moral character or a &#8220;weakness of will.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Critics of the DSM have long argued that the medical model divorces mental illnesses from the social and historical conditions in which they arise. By assuming that the cause of mental illness lies entirely within the person and not in society, the medical model and the DSM depoliticize the distress of the disadvantaged and marginalized. At the same time, the business of codifying, and treating, mental illnesses is also quite lucrative, sparking concerns that the needs of those suffering often come second to the needs of the insurance and pharmaceutical industries.</p> \\n\\n<p>Recently, however, the loudest critiques of the DSM have come not from the Left, or the anti-psychiatric movements, but from the major players in the mental health field itself. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) &#8212; the largest funder of mental health research and a longtime stalwart of the DSM &#8212; has dramatically changed its position on the diagnostic manual over the past few years. Now sharply critical of the manual&#8217;s validity, the NIMH is calling for the field to move away from the diagnostic manual altogether and towards a new paradigm of mental illness.</p> \\n\\n<p>DSM diagnoses are limited to be sure, and many of the NIMH&#8217;s criticisms are right on target. But the institute&#8217;s alternative vision does nothing to challenge the binary medical model of mental illness. Instead, the NIMH&#8217;s plan moves the field more closely towards it by arguing that any understanding of mental illnesses needs to be based in objective, biological data.</p> \\n\\n<p>The NIMH&#8217;s policy shift away from the DSM and towards a new biology of mental illness did not come out of the blue. It is a direct response to the pharmaceutical industry&#8217;s failure to develop effective, profitable psychiatric drugs over the past decade. The NIMH hopes to revitalize the state of psychiatric research, and help solve the profitability crisis in the pharmaceutical industry &#8212; thus ensuring continued investment by Big Pharma &#8212; by aligning the way psychologists and psychiatrists think about, and treat, mental illness with the needs of major drug companies.</p>',\n",

That\\'s a strange one. Journalists withhold information all the time -&#8211; especially in wartime, but at other times, too. White House reporters regularly have information about presidential travels that they don\\'t share. Protecting a president\\'s security on a trip into a war zone is hardly a preposterous notion. Nor, after all, was the trip kept a secret.&amp;#160;Thirteen pool correspondents, including Terence Hunt of the AP, Mike Allen of The Washington Post, Richard Keil of Bloomberg News, a Reuters reporter, and several photographers <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A17508-2003Nov27.html\" type=\"external\">came along</a>. Indeed, the real complaint for many seems to be precisely that the trip DID eventually become&amp;#160;a big story. As Harper\\'s Magazine publisher Rick MacArthur <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=03/12/01/155219\" type=\"external\">put it</a>: \"The White House press corps has turned into a full time press agency for the President of the United States.\" The only proper thing, he said, would have been \"to refuse the secrecy agreement and say we\\'re not going to be participants in a photo opportunity, which is merely done to help your re-election campaign, and if that aborts the trip, well, it aborts the trip.\"Goodness! If the White House press refused to participate in every photo opportunity that advanced a president\\'s political agenda, they\\'d be out of business. Half of what they DO is photo ops. It\\'s just that this one was in Baghdad, not the Rose Garden.</p> \\n\\n<p>Don\\'t get me wrong. We\\'ve got good reason to worry about the Bush family reputation for punishing reporters who don\\'t go along.

              " 8382: '<p /> \\n\\n<p>Authors of serious books seldom have cause to celebrate, but Larry Stratton and I have two reasons to open the champagne. Crown Publishing, a division of Random House, has announced a second printing of the second edition of The Tyranny of Good Intentions, and the noted civil libertarian and defense attorney, Harvey Silverglate, has just published a book covering many of the same legal cases and vetting our conclusion that in the United States every American is in grave danger from unscrupulous prosecutors who target the innocent.</p> \\n\\n<p>For two decades I have been attempting to make Americans aware that the danger to their liberty comes not from foreign adversaries, terrorists, or criminals, but from prosecutors, who have destroyed law as a shield of the innocent and turned law into a weapon against the innocent. The Tyranny of Good Intentions (the publisher\\'s title) documents how the legal principles that protect our civil liberties were eroded by prosecutors even before the Bush regime obliterated what remained of the Bill of Rights.</p> \\n\\n<p>The struggle has been uphill, because neither the right-wing nor the left-wing is emotionally content with the facts that Stratton and I present. Conservatives tend to see civil liberties as liberal coddling devices for criminals and, today, for terrorists. Predisposed to \"law and order,\" conservatives align with police and prosecutors. They object to accounts of police misbehavior and prosecutorial abuse as propaganda in behalf of the criminal class.</p> \\n\\n<p>The left-wing tends to see law as a tool of oppression that \"the rich\" use to control the lower classes, and liberals fret that \"the rich\" get off by hiring good lawyers, while the poor and minorities are ground under. Consequently, leftists object to the demonstration that even the very rich, such as Michael Milken, Martha Stewart, and Leona Helmsley, and even law and accounting firms, are victims of wrongful prosecution. Confusing wealth with villainy, leftists cannot free themselves from the emotional predilection that a convicted rich person must have been so guilty that not even the best lawyers could get them off.</p> \\n\\n<p>The Tyranny of Good Intentions had a second printing of a second edition because of word of mouth, not because of reviews. Neither the right nor the left objects to wrongful prosecution as long as the victim is a bete noir. Sir Thomas More\\'s question (A Man For All Seasons)?what will happen to the innocent if we cut down the law in pursuit of devils??rings no warning among right or left.</p> \\n\\n<p>With this point made, I have come not to praise myself and my coauthor, but to praise Harvey Silverglate. If The Tyranny of Good Intentions cannot convince you, then perhaps Three Felonies A Day: How the Feds Target the Innocent can, and, if not, then both together surely will.</p> \\n\\n<p>The Tyranny of Good Intentions is a broad stroke. It demonstrates how each civil liberty has been eroded away. Prosecutorial abuse is one chapter in the book.</p> \\n\\n<p>Silverglates? Three Felonies A Day focuses on how federal prosecutors invent creative interpretations of statutes, sometimes creating new felonies out of vague language or thin air, felonies never legislated by Congress. Federal criminal law is today so vast and so poorly worded that Silverglate reports, truthfully, that each of us, every American, commits three felonies every day without knowing it.</p> \\n\\n<p>Federal judges, an increasing number of whom are former federal prosecutors, permit the prosecution of Americans for crimes that the defendants did not know were crimes, crimes that never before existed until the federal prosecutor brought the charge. The invention of crimes by prosecutors violates every known legal principle in Anglo-American law. Yet, it has become commonplace. Defense attorneys, a group that also increasingly consists of former federal prosecutors, as Silverglate accurately reports, have lost confidence that it is possible to defend a client from a federal prosecution and see their role, not as the defense, but as negotiator of a plea bargain that reduces the charges and prison time of the defendant, no matter how innocent.</p> \\n\\n<p>Silverglate shows that many of the plea bargains create precedents that prosecutors can exploit to trap more innocent victims.</p> \\n\\n<p>The reader by now is asking why prosecutors would waste time on the innocent when there are so many real crimes. Silverglate provides conclusive answers. For example, politically ambitious federal prosecutors, such as Rudy Giuliani and William Weld, pick high profile targets to frame in order to build name recognition for political careers. Giuliani picked Michael Milken and Leona Helmsley. Weld picked Boston mayor Kevin White. Giuliani went on to be Mayor of New York and a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. Weld went on to be a two-term governor of Massachusetts. Leura Canary, perhaps at the urging of Karl Rove, picked Alabama Governor Don Siegelman. Michael J. Sullivan picked Thomas Finneran, Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, and so on.</p> \\n\\n<p>From Silverglate\\'s book, the reader can learn how federal prosecutors manage their frame-ups of innocents. For a targeted city or state political figure, the prosecutor first hunts for a criminal act somewhere in the bureaucracy. Perhaps some low level person has extorted a bribe for a permit. Once such a person is caught, he or she is told that charges will be dropped if information is given that can be used to implicate the mayor or Speaker of the House or governor. As federal district court judges now permit hearsay and uncorroborated testimony, a totally innocent high profile person can be snared on the basis of testimony by a petty crook low in the bureaucracy.</p> \\n\\n<p>This is the way America works today. Just as state and local police cannot stand up to the FBI, elected state and local officials are powerless in the face of their pursuit by corrupt federal prosecutors.</p> \\n\\n<p>Silverglate himself was the attorney in some of the landmark cases that he reports. The reader, even one with the usual illusions and delusions that blind Americans to their predicament, will be scared by Silverglate\\'s documented account, case by case, of how easy it is in \"freedom and democracy\" America to frame the totally innocent.</p> \\n\\n<p>In Silverglate\\'s concluding chapter, \"For Whom the Bell Tolls,\" the answer is obvious even to a naif: \"It tolls for all.\"</p>',\n",
              " 9298: '<p>The New York Times, whose regional bureau chief has a son in the Israeli military, reports that Israel has just appointed a panel charged with investigating its attack on an aid flotilla that killed nine aid volunteers, including a 19-year-old American.</p> \\n\\n<p>Isabel Kershner, who is an Israeli citizen and has refused to answer questions about her possible family ties to the Israeli military, writes the report.</p> \\n\\n<p>Kershner reports that the White House hailed the announcement of the panel as an &#8220;important step forward,&#8221; stating that &#8220;the structure and terms of reference of Israel&#8217;s proposed independent public commission can meet the standard of a prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>In her story, Kershner reports that the panel will include eminent Irish Nobel Peace Laureate Lord David Trimble as an observer, but omits the fact that Trimble is a leader of the newly formed pro-Israel organization &#8220;Friends of Israel&#8221; and is close to Netanyahu associate Dore Gold.</p> \\n\\n<p>Irish journalist Patrick Roberts writes, &#8220;This is a little like putting the fox in charge of the hen house.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Kershner reports that the other foreign observer is Brig. Gen. Ken Watkins, former judge advocate general of Canadian Forces, but fails to mention that Watkins is known for stonewalling a 2009 House of Commons investigation into Afghan prisoner abuse.</p> \\n\\n<p>One House of Commons member commented at the time about Watkins&#8217; lack of cooperation with the investigation: &#8220;Obviously the cover-up continues.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Kershner informs readers that the panel will be led by a retired Israeli Supreme Court Justice, but fails to mention reports that he does not believe in such a panel and opposed foreign participation.</p> \\n\\n<p>Kershner reports in the bottom half of her story that Israel&#8217;s Ha&#8217;aretz newspaper calls the proposed panel a &#8220;farce,&#8221; but does not mention that this is a longstanding pattern for Israeli governmental investigations (and lack thereof) into military human rights abuses. For example:</p> \\n\\n<p>&#176; From 2001 through 2006 the Israeli State Attorney&#8217;s office received more than 500 complaints about abuse of interrogees. There was not a single criminal investigation.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#176; In 2005 Israeli human rights organization B&#8217;Tselem released a report entitled &#8220;Israeli military grants impunity when soldiers kill Palestinian civilians,&#8221; finding that although Israeli soldiers had killed at least 1,694 Palestinian civilians, including 536 minors, only one soldier had been convicted of &#8220;causing the death of a Palestinian.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#176; In 2009 eleven Israeli human rights organizations released a joint report in which they called on the Israeli government to &#8220;Stop whitewashing suspected crimes in Gaza.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#176; In 2010 B&#8217;Tselem found that the Israeli military&#8217;s &#8220;cover-up of phosphorous shelling in Gaza proves army cannot investigate itself.&#8221; An Amnesty International report concurred in this conclusion, finding that Israel&#8217;s investigations into Cast Lead had not met &#8220;international standards of independence, impartiality, transparency, promptness and effectiveness.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>In her story Kershner reports Netanyahu&#8217;s allegation that the blockade &#8220;is necessary to prevent Hamas from smuggling in weapons or materials needed to make them, and to weaken Hamas control.&#8221; She goes on to acknowledge that &#8220;there is a growing consensus abroad that the blockade has taken a toll mainly on civilians,&#8221; but neglects to report the fact that Israeli closures of Gaza preceded the election of Hamas and that the &#8220;toll&#8221; is massive and calamitous.</p> \\n\\n<p>She also fails to include any of the vast evidence for such a consensus, for example:</p> \\n\\n<p>Nearly 99 percent of Gaza&#8217;s 4,000 fishermen are now considered either poor (making between $100 and $190 a month) or very poor (earning less than $100 a month); there are acute, sometimes lethal shortages of fuel, cash, cooking gas and other basic supplies; 98 percent of industrial operations have been shut down since 2007; and 3,500 families are still displaced from last year&#8217;s invasion due to Israel&#8217;s blockade on building materials.</p> \\n\\n<p>Although the Israeli government has failed to investigate itself honestly and thoroughly through the years, a great many respected international human rights organizations from Christian Aid to the Red Cross have done so, documenting a pattern of widespread human rights abuses by the Israeli military.</p> \\n\\n<p>In 2006 independent researchers Patrick O&#8217;Connor and Rachel Roberts found that since fall 2000:</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;[T]hree of the leading human rights organizations focusing on Israel/Palestine &#8211; Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and the Israeli organization B&#8217;Tselem &#8211; published 76 reports focused primarily on Israeli abuses of Palestinian rights, and four reports primarily focused on Palestinians abuses of Israeli or Palestinian rights. This weighting suggests that Israel has committed a disproportionate share of the human rights violations.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>During this time, the New York Times published two news stories on reports documenting Israeli human rights abuses and two stories on reports documenting Palestinian human rights abuses.</p> \\n\\n<p>In other words, in its &#8220;even-handed&#8221; style, the New York Times covered fifty percent of the reports on human rights abuses committed by Palestinians, while covering under three percent of those detailing human abuses perpetrated by Israelis.</p> \\n\\n<p>ALISON WEIR is executive director of If Americans Knew and a board member of the Council for the National Interest.
